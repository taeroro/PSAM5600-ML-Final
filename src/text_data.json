He would settle in one particular community or another and paint portraits in that vicinity until moving on in search for more commissions.  This sitter may have come from Lansingburgh or Hoosick, New York.  Phillips's finest works are characterized by their radical simplicity and coloristic refinement; here his forceful design is evident in the sitter's penetrating gaze and taut linear silhouette.","1":"","2":"The father and daughter in this elegant interior display the wealth and confidence of the patrician class of seventeenth-century Amsterdam. They wear luxurious black clothing (the daughter is in the costume of a grown woman), and the father\u2019s lute is both a costly foreign import and a mark of refinement. De Keyser excelled in the depiction of objects in perspective, such as the worn lute case and the classically ornamented doorway.","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"This portrait was painted in 1756 when the subject was twelve years old. The roses in the sitter\u2019s hand and hair are traditional symbols of feminine virtue as well as a play on her family name.","7":"This is a highly finished proposal, or modello, for Subleyras's most important commission: the full-scale design for a mosaic altarpiece for Saint Peter's in Rome. It depicts Saint Basil the Great (ca. 330\u2013379) celebrating the Mass in the presence of the Emperor Valens, a heretical Arian. Surrounded by priests, Basil receives the wine for consecration. Valens's required gifts of bread are presented by figures at the left while to the right the emperor swoons, moved by the solemnity of the Mass. The painter seems to have retained the modello for himself. It is recorded in his posthumous inventory, and remains in its original frame.","8":"In 1745 Mademoiselle Duronceray, a singer, dancer, and comedienne, married Charles Simon Favart (1710\u20131792) , the father of French comic opera. Among her best known roles was that of the heroine in The Loves of Bastien and Bastienne, 1753, in which she inspired a revolution in theatrical costume by wearing authentic peasant dress. Drouais's elegant secular portrait recalls traditional representations of Saint Cecilia, patron saint of music.","9":"The fifth president of the United States, James Monroe, was a Virginian who enjoyed the advantages of being the disciple and political prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Thomas Jefferson. Before becoming president, he had held many diplomatic posts, including service as ambassador to France and to England. The year after this picture was completed, he issued the famous Monroe Doctrine, a statement against any intervention from foreign governments in the affairs of the hemisphere. The three-quarter pose at a desk with books and papers, the billowing drapery, and the liberal use of strong, pure red are all elements of a formula that Stuart, like the Spanish Goya, frequently employed in portraits of statesman.","10":"","11":"The daughter of King Philip IV of Spain, Mar\u00eda Teresa became the presumptive heir to the throne in 1646. Princely suitors from around Europe were keen to have a portrait of the young infanta as she reached marriageable age. Originally bust length but subsequently cut down and then reenlarged at the bottom, this likeness of Mar\u00eda Teresa wearing a wig with butterfly ribbons may have served as a model for Vel\u00e1zquez's assistants to copy as they met the demand for official portraits of the young princess. In 1660 the infanta married Louis XIV, her first cousin, becoming queen of France.","12":"Augustus Brine (1769\u20131840) was the son of Admiral James Brine of the Royal British Navy, by his first wife, Jane Knight. At the age of thirteen, in 1782, Brine enlisted in the Navy as a midshipman aboard the \"Belliqueux\" under the command of his father. In 1790, he was made lieutenant and, eight years later, he became a commander. During the War of 1812, he commanded the \"Medway\" and successfully captured the American brig \"Syran.\" He was named rear admiral in 1822. This portrait of young Brine was painted in 1782, seven years after Copley had arrived in England.","13":"The full-length portrait of Susan Walker Morse (1819\u20131885), the eldest daughter of the artist, was painted during the crucial years of the invention of Morse's telegraph (ca. 1835\u201337). The painting shows  the girl at about the age of seventeen, sitting with a sketchbook in her lap and pencil in hand with her eyes raised in contemplation.  Although traditionally described as a Muse, the figure is more likely a personification of the art of drawing or design. Morse drew on the full extent of his European training, taking from the works of Rubens and Veronese in what was to be an ambitious farewell to his career as an artist. Stymied by a lack of financial success, he abandoned painting for science and inventing. This painting was first exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1837, where it won enthusiastic praise. Susan married Edward Lind in 1839 and moved to his sugar plantation in Puerto Rico, returning often to New York to spend extended periods with her father, who had been left a widower when Susan was just six. She gradually grew less and less happy with her husband and plantation life. Lind died in 1882; in 1885, Susan set out to return to New York permanently but tragically was lost at sea.","14":"","15":"Romanino painted this expressive depiction of the flagellation of Christ as a processional banner for a confraternity, or lay religious group, in Brescia, a city not far from Milan. Contemporary German prints, which circulated widely in northern Italy, inspired its dramatically compressed composition and the vehemence of the brutish executioners. Caravaggio, the groundbreaking artist of the next generation, spent his formative years in the region and almost certainly knew and admired this painting. On its reverse, Romanino painted the Madonna of Mercy surrounded by kneeling members, now unfortunately somewhat damaged. For an image of the reverse visit metmuseum.org.","16":"","17":"","18":"This early portrait by Vernet, the leading French battle painter of the nineteenth century, depicts one of the Mameluke soldiers who long comprised the military caste of Egypt. He is traditionally identified as Roustam Raza, who entered Napoleon\u2019s personal service in Cairo in 1799 and remained with him until 1814. The genesis and early history of the portrait are unknown, but it is entirely possible that the well-connected Vernet, who came from a dynasty of successful artists, was able to secure a sitting with a member of the Emperor\u2019s bodyguard.","19":"Zhao Zhiqian, one of the most influential calligraphers and painters of the late Qing period, inscribed his portrait: If the world praises me, I shall not accept such praise,Of those who try to destroy me, I shall not complain.Only the painter can capture my likeness. Hanging on the wall it will inspire people to call out, \"It is Zhao, it is Zhao!\" I neither walk nor sit but stand alone, and with a smile say nothing.(Wen Fong, trans., Between Two Cultures: Late-Nineteenth- and Early-Twentieth-Century Chinese Paintings from the Robert H. Ellsworth Collection in The Metropolitan Museum of Art [New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 2001], p. 40)Brush vitality, not optical fidelity, was the traditional criterion for lifelikeness in Chinese painting, except in portraiture. For this reason portrait painting was traditionally held in low regard in China. The praise that Zhao, a scholar-artist, voices for the lifelikeness of his portrait testifies to the growing respect in the nineteenth century for verisimilitude as a criterion applicable in all the fine arts.","20":"The subject of this astonishingly vital portrait was a wealthy Boston merchant. He chose to be painted wearing a loose but elegant banyan, or lounge robe\u2014a popular gentleman\u2019s fashion at the time\u2014and a turban instead of a formal wig. Most striking about the portrait is its convincing sense of reality, which Copley achieved through various means. He meticulously painted every fold of cloth and bit of pattern in Sherburne\u2019s damask gown as well as every fleshy wrinkle on his face and hands. Likewise, by lighting the picture strongly from the left, Copley created a tangibly solid figure.","21":"The Hebrew heroine Judith presents the severed head of the Assyrian general who besieged her city, having seduced and then beheaded him with his own sword. Appropriately, she is \"dressed to kill\" and wears an elaborate contemporary costume that would have appealed to Cranach\u2019s courtly patrons. The painter and his workshop produced several versions of this successful composition, which contrasts the gruesome head and the serene beauty of the biblical heroine. At the lower right is Cranach's insignia: a crowned winged serpent with a ring in its mouth.","22":"Departing from earlier devotional portraits, the sitter appears distracted from her prayer book by something on our side of the frame. This portrait reflects humanist interests and a modern approach to portraiture. Beyond indicating her piety, Metsys focused on more individual, human aspects of the sitter, such as the very natural position of her fingers between the pages. ","23":"Painter to King Francis I, Jean Clouet played a key role in establishing the Renaissance portraiture tradition in France, yet this is his only documented painted portrait. It depicts Guillaume Bud\u00e9, librarian to Francis I and the leading humanist of sixteenth-century France. Similar to the sitter in Metsys\u2019s Portrait of a Woman (32.100.47), Bud\u00e9\u2019s fingers hold his page, as if interrupted. With the quill in his right hand, he has written in Greek, \"While it seems to be good to get what one desires, the greatest good is not to desire what one does not need\" (Joannes Stobaeus, 3.5.18).","24":"Theodore Duret (1838\u20131927), heir to a firm of Cognac dealers, was a collector, orientalist, and art critic. An early champion of Courbet, Manet, and the Impressionists, he was introduced to Whistler by Manet. He posed for this portrait in 1883 at Whistler's London studio at 13 Tite Street. At Duret's request, Whistler painted him in full evening dress, but Whistler suggested that he hold a pink domino, an addition necessary to the decorative arrangement of the composition. Whistler worked on the portrait over a long period of time, even though the finished work ultimately looks like a rapid sketch. Acclaimed when exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1885, it was ranked by many as the best portrait of Duret painted by any of the great Realist artists of the period.","25":"El Greco\u2019s candid portraits have been consistently admired for their naturalism and psychological insight, even when (as in the eighteenth century) his other works fell out of favor.This portrait of about 1595\u20131600 has been alternately accepted and rejected as a searching self-portrait. Although there is no documented portrait of the artist, he seems to have cast himself in supporting roles within some of his pictures and these bear some resemblance to the present sitter.","26":"Jonathan Dwight (1743\u20131831) was the great-grandson of the esteemed Connecticut clergyman Jonathan Edwards. Steward\u2019s rather unusual portrait provides a clear view of Dwight\u2019s hometown of Springfield, Massachusetts, in the background and a striking marker of the sitter\u2019s appearance: a large, hairy mole on his left cheek.","27":"This portrait of President Washington, called the Gibbs-Channing-Avery portrait, is one of eighteen similar works known as the Vaughan group. The first of this type, presumably painted from life and then copied in all the others, originally belonged to Samuel Vaughan, a London merchant living in Philadelphia and a close friend of Washington. This original portrait by Stuart, painted in 1795 according to Rembrandt Peale, was subsequently acquired by Joseph Harrison of Philadelphia. While in Harrison's collection, Rembrandt Peale copied it many times. The version now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, considered to be one of the earliest and best replicas, was sold to Stuart's close friend, Colonel George Gibbs, and subsequently descended in the Gibbs family.","28":"Bol was a pupil of Rembrandt in the late 1630s, and followed his teacher's style until the middle of the century. During the 1650s Bol became established in Amsterdam society, enjoyed considerable success as a portraitist and history painter, and adopted a more colorful, fluid, and Flemish style. The elaborate silver basket in the present picture appears again in a double portrait of 1661 in Antwerp.","29":"M\u00e4da Primavesi\u2019s expression and posture convey a remarkable degree of confidence for a nine-year-old girl, even one who was, by her own account, willful and a tomboy. Klimt made numerous preliminary sketches for this portrait, experimenting with different poses, outfits, and backgrounds before deciding to show M\u00e4da standing tall in a specially-made dress amid a profusion of springlike patterns. The picture testifies to the sophisticated taste of her parents, banker and industrialist Otto Primavesi and his wife Eugenia, who were ardent supporters of progressive Viennese art and design. In fact, Klimt soon painted Eugenia\u2019s portrait (Toyota Municipal Museum of Art, Japan).","30":"This portrait of K\u00f8bke\u2019s younger brother in his seaman\u2019s uniform was painted soon before the artist left Copenhagen for a sojourn in Italy. It is an incisive likeness, remarkable for its psychological intensity. K\u00f8bke, who is widely regarded as the greatest Danish painter to emerge from the Copenhagen Academy of Fine Arts, brought a distinctive clarity and luminosity to the naturalist aesthetic of his teacher, Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg.","31":"The young teenage boy in this remarkably lifelike portrait looks calmly at the viewer, his head in three-quarter view. He is dressed in a white Roman tunic with a narrow purple clavus (a vertical stripe) over the right shoulder. A mantle is draped over the left shoulder. The boy wears his dark brown hair short, with locks brushed to both sides of the forehead. The inscription in dark purple pigment below the neckline of the tunic is in Greek, which was the common language of the eastern Mediterranean at the time. Scholars do not completely agree on the inscription's translation. The boy's name (\"Eutyches, freedman of Kasanios\") seems indisputable; then follows either \"son of Herakleides Evandros\" or \"Herakleides, son of Evandros.\" It is also unclear whether the \"I signed\" at the end of the inscription refers to the painter of the portrait or to the manumission (act of freeing a slave) that would have been witnessed by Herakleides or Evandros. An artist's signature would be unique in mummy portraits.Paintings of this type, often called Faiyum portraits (though not all of them come from the Faiyum oasis), are typical products of the multicultural, multiethnic society of Roman Egypt. Most of them are painted in the elaborate encaustic technique, in which pigments were mixed with hot or cold beeswax and other ingredients, such as egg, resin, and linseed oil. This versatile medium allowed artists to create images that in many ways are akin to oil paintings. The boy's head, for instance, stands out from the light olive-colored background, creating an impression of real depth. His face is modeled with flowing brushstrokes and a subtle blend of light and dark colors. Shadows on the left side of the face, neck, and garment and bright shiny spots on the forehead and below the right eye indicate a strong source of light on the boy's right. Most arresting are the dark brown eyes with black pupils reflecting the light with bright spots. This manner of painting, which is very different from the traditional Egyptian style but was well known in Graeco-Roman Egypt, originated in Classical Greece in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C.E.Although the painting techique on Faiyum portrait panels is Greek, their use is entirely Egyptian. When a person died, the portrait panel was placed over the face of the mummy with parts of the outermost wrapping holding it in place. This implies Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife. After having been ruled for three hundred years by a Greek (Macedonian) dynasty and a century or more by Roman administrators, Roman Egypt was an extremely diverse civilization. The population consisted of Roman citizens and citizens of Greek cities such as Alexandria (both of these groups made up of peoples of many different ethnicities) and native Egyptians. The subjects of the mummy portraits clearly were dressed and coiffed like Romans, and many of them bore Greek names or names that were Greek versions of Egyptian names. However, they and their families found consolation in the ancient Egyptian beliefs about the afterlife.Link to the Artist ProjectY.Z. Kami on Egyptian mummy portraits","32":"Phillips pursued a long and successful career over fifty years, taking to the road as an itinerant artist painting portraits of clusters of friends, relatives, and neighbors in New York State and New England. His stock in trade was the plain likeness, devoid of shadows or modeling. Although he depended on repetitious formulas to work efficiently as he traveled the countryside, he was nevertheless able to individualize his sitters imaginatively. In \"Mrs. Mayer and Daughter,\" Phillips\u2019s masterful design abilities are evident in the cleanly contained forms of the mother and child, enriched by the use of brilliant, saturated color and careful detail.","33":"With characteristic business acumen, Rubens created a market for a new art form: very large hunting scenes painted on canvas, of which this one is the first. The few earlier examples were either models for or copies after tapestries, but Rubens\u2019s large \"hunts\" of about 1616\u201321 were made as replacements for that very expensive medium. This canvas, originally more symmetrical in design, was trimmed at the top and left side because (according to a client in 1616) \"none but great Princes have houses fitt to hange it up in.\" Rubens painted the picture with the help of assistants but declared that the wolves were his own work.","34":"This newly discovered painting depicting an unidentified warrior is executed at a size usually reserved for portraits of emperors and shoguns, and it ranks among the largest and finest secular portraits from Japan. Although the family crest of wild orange is associated with the Shibata family of the late sixteenth century, the sitter's exact identity remains unknown.The unnamed samurai, clearly an important member of a warrior clan, is depicted grasping the end of his long beard, which was banned in the seventeenth century as an expression of antiestablishment sentiment and unwelcome individualism. His eyes seem to twinkle with mischievous pleasure. Such lively, informal representation was the norm in secular depictions of deceased people, while more formality was standard in portraits of those still living. Details of the sitter's robe and swords also point to a late-sixteenth-century date for the painting.","35":"Mazo was Vel\u00e1zquez\u2019s most gifted assistant and his son-in-law, having married his daughter Francisca in 1633. Mar\u00eda Teresa, daughter of King Philip IV of Spain and his first queen, Isabel de Borb\u00f3n, was portrayed by Mazo when she was seven years old. In 1660 the Infanta married her cousin Louis XIV and became Queen of France. Another portrait of her, by Vel\u00e1zquez, is also in the Museum\u2019s collection. Mazo reused a canvas for this portrait; a group of putti from the previous work is visible through the red curtain.","36":"","37":"","38":"Of the four portraits that C\u00e9zanne painted of his wife wearing a shawl-collared red dress, this is the only one to show her in an elaborately furnished interior. Seated in a high-backed yellow chair and wedged between well-placed props that seem to bend to her form and shift to her weight, Madame C\u00e9zanne is the lynchpin of a tilting, spatially complex composition. The mottled blue wall, the dark red band that edges the wainscoting, and the mirror over the fireplace at left identify the setting as the apartment that C\u00e9zanne rented at 15 quai d\u2019Anjou, Paris, from 1888 to 1890.","39":"Vig\u00e9e Le Brun was the most important woman artist of her time. She was a favorite of Marie Antoinette, through whose good offices she was admitted in 1783 to the Acad\u00e9mie Royale de Peinture et de Sculpture as one of only four women members. To the Salon of that year, her public debut, she sent three history paintings and at least ten portraits, of which this was one. Madame Grand was a minor celebrity, a beautiful blond born in India, ill-educated but musical and clever; she would eventually become the wife of the minister and diplomat Talleyrand.","40":"","41":"Dou was Rembrandt\u2019s first pupil, only seven years younger than his master. The older artist inspired his student\u2019s lifelong commitment to self-portraiture, often in fanciful or theatrical costume. In some self-portraits, Dou adopted the guise of an aristocrat, but here he proudly displays the tools of his trade. Rather than adopt Rembrandt\u2019s signature rough manner of painting, Dou became famous for his jewel-like surfaces and painstaking method, qualities that led Philips Angel to single him out as an exemplary artist in his lecture \"The Praise of Painting.\" ","42":"Philip is shown wearing a gold chain and the emblem of the Order of the Golden Fleece. Vel\u00e1zquez was paid for this portrait of the king on December 4, 1624. The artist had arrived in Madrid in the summer of 1623 and was made painter to the king that August. Don Garc\u00eda P\u00e9rez de Araciel, an important person at court, commissioned the portrait, which is an autograph repetition of the official portrait Vel\u00e1zquez painted for the king (now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid). The 1624 receipt for the painting is also in The Met\u2019s collection (for more information, visit metmuseum.org).","43":"Toward the end of his life, Ribot, who was strongly influenced by seventeenth-century Spanish painters, especially Ribera, brought a vigorous realism and a predilection for contrasting values to the subject of Breton and Norman peasants. Beginning in the 1870s, he painted several group portraits similar to this one.","44":"Mary Sherburne (1735\u20131799) was the daughter of Joseph Sherburne (23.143) by his marriage to Mary Watson in 1734. As her father's sole heir, she received a substantial fortune. In 1763, she married Jerathmael Bowers, a wealthy and prominent Quaker living in Swansea, Massachusetts. They had one son and three daughters. This portrait is based on a British mezzotint by James McArdell, after a portrait of Lady Caroline Russell painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds in 1759. Copley followed this model with precision, substituting the face of the sitter for that of Lady Russell. Tradition has it that the portrait was painted about the time of the sitter's marriage in 1763. The frame of the painting is thought to be the original.","45":"A painter of miniatures and cabinet-sized portraits, as well as an engraver, Wood moved from upstate New York to the city at the age of fifteen and apprenticed to a silversmith. He copied miniature portraits that had been left in the shop for framing and these attracted the attention of John Wesley Jarvis, who took Wood into a highly lucrative partnership. Wood moved to Philadelphia in 1813 and later worked in Baltimore and Washington, D.C., pleasing clients in each city with his meticulously executed portraits. He used gum arabic quite liberally, a medium that gave strong contrast and opacity to his watercolor. His handsome self-portrait epitomizes his most captivating work: a sharply defined, realistic likeness with brilliantly rendered coiffure, against a background expertly shaded to approximate sky.","46":"Hannah Fayerweather (1727\u20131790) was the daughter of Thomas and Hannah Waldo Fayerweather. She was baptized at the First Church in Boston in February 12, 1727. She was married twice, in 1745 to Parr Tolman and in 1756 to John Winthrop, a professor of mathematics and natural history at Harvard University and a noted astronomer. Although this portrait has traditionally been dated 1774, a receipt dated June 24, 1773, places its execution in the previous year. The portrait is one of a number in which Copley prominently featured a beautifully reflective tabletop.","47":"Pourbus was court painter of Archduke Albert in Brussels when in 1600 he went to Italy at the invitation of Vincenzo Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. This portrait must depict the Duke of Mantua's daughter, Margherita, to judge from Pourbus's full-length portrait of her dated 1605 in the Uffizi, Florence. In this period Rubens also worked for Vincenzo Gonzaga, but he eagerly left the painting of formal portraits and a gallery of \"beauties\" to Pourbus, who in 1611 became Maria de' Medici's court painter in Paris.","48":"The sitter (1721-1775) commissioned this piece at the same time that Copley was painting full-length oil portraits of him and his wife, Martha Swett, for their home in Marblehead, Massachusetts (Wadsworth Athenaeum, Hartford).  Another version of the miniature is owned by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.","49":"","50":"The portrait\u2014one of Vig\u00e9e Le Brun's finest\u2014shows Emmanuel de Crussol at the height of his career, wearing the blue sash and collar of the order of the Saint-Esprit and the Maltese cross of the order of the Knights of Malta. His red hair is powdered. Crussol entered the service of the comte d'Artois (the future Charles X) in 1773. Having been a professional soldier, at court he became a gifted professional actor.","51":"Feke emerged during the 1740s as the most gifted native-born artist working in the Northeast. The subject of this portrait, the Irish-born Tench Francis (1690?\u20131758), received legal training in England and emigrated to America in about 1720. He became the attorney general of Pennsylvania in 1741 and commissioned this portrait five years later. The picture is important as one of the few signed and dated works proving that Feke was active in Philadelphia in 1746. Thinly painted in elegant Rococo pastel colors but reflecting Quaker values in the sitter\u2019s modest attire, the work represents Francis at the height of his career, as a pillar of society.","52":"","53":"In this double portrait, Cadwallader Colden, who was a physician, botanist, and physicist, is shown with his arm around his grandson. Colden held strong views on the education of his grandchildren and he often tutored Warren. For the realistic facial expressions, the successful ease of the poses, and the rich color, Pratt was indebted to the art of Copley, who visited New York in 1771. Pratt also painted a standing full-length portrait of Colden, which can be seen at the New-York Historical Society.","54":"With her sidelong glance and seductive smile, this raven-haired woman coyly toys with the strings of pearls that, together with mounted jewels, ornament her silk dress. Like his mentor, the great sculptor Gianlorenzo Bernini (1598\u20131680), Gaulli sketched his sitters as they went about their business to capture the quality of a living presence. The outstanding master of illusionistic ceilings, in the second half of the seventeenth century Gaulli was also the most esteemed portrait painter in Rome.","55":"On his way to Spain in 1885 by way of London, Chase decided to introduce himself to James McNeill Whistler (1834\u20131903), whose works he had long admired. Whistler urged him to stay longer so they could paint portraits of one another. In depicting Whistler, Chase echoed traits that appear in his subject\u2019s recent portraits, such as that of Th\u00e9odore Duret (13.20): an elongated figure, a low-keyed palette, free brushwork, and ambiguous space. Although Chase must have intended to honor Whistler and his style with these echoes, Whistler was offended, calling the work a \u201cmonstrous lampoon\u201d and possibly destroying his portrait of Chase.","56":"A typical work by Peto, this painting bears the false signature of William Michael Harnett, his better-known contemporary. Actually, Harnett seems to have been inspired to create \u201crack\u201d paintings by Peto\u2019s example in pictures such as this one. Some of the objects stuck in the grid are dated or datable and provide clues to the years when the artist seems to have worked on the painting. The photograph of Peto\u2019s daughter shown at the upper left was probably added, over an earlier portrait, around 1900, when the girl was about seven. Peto\u2019s delineation of objects is more generalized and less purely descriptive than Harnett\u2019s.","57":"Portraits of past emperors, displayed in the imperial ancestral temple, served an important function in state rituals. In Qing times, the veneration of former rulers by Manchu emperors served the additional purpose of confirming the Qing dynasty's legitimacy in the succession of China's ruling houses.These miniature portraits by the court artist Yao Wenhan are a typical product of the Qianlong Painting Academy. Based on earlier full-scale works, the albums may have been made as presentation pieces or as a handy reference showing China's most famous legendary and historical rulers. The pronounced use of shading in the depiction of many of the faces shows the influence of Western chiaroscuro modeling techniques introduced into China by Jesuit artists serving the Qing court.","58":"While there has never been any doubt of Copley\u2019s innate talent, these portraits give new meaning to the word \u201cprecocious.\u201d At about the age of fifteen, with no formal training and very little opportunity to have studied acclaimed works of art, Copley not only could paint competently but also knew how to serve his patrons best: with accurate but richly embellished likenesses. These handsome siblings (see also 2002.612), offspring of John and Priscilla Brown Greenleaf of Boston, wear just the sort of elaborate, inventive costumes that became the artist\u2019s forte. Copley\u2019s source for John\u2019s exotic cap and pose was a print after Sir Godfrey Kneller\u2019s portrait of Lord Bury as a child.","59":"In 1785 the British naval officer John Gell (1738\u20131806) had just completed his duty on the seventy-gun Monarca, which he had commanded in a series of battles against the French. For this portrait, Stuart used as a model Sir Joshua Reynolds\u2019s heroic \"Commodore Augustus Keppel\" (1752; National Maritime Museum, Greenwich, UK). In homage to Reynolds, Stuart employed a combination of fine and slapdash brushwork, conveying an image of both heroism and naturalism. He exhibited \"Captain John Gell\" at London\u2019s Royal Academy of Arts in 1785, when the British portraitist John Hoppner commented that it was \u201cadmirably well-painted without trickery to dazzle the eye or mislead the judgment.\u201d","60":"The Connecticut portraits Earl painted after returning from a seven-year stay in England are his greatest works as they combined his natural talents with the lessons he had gleaned from English art of the period. He rendered most of this portrait of Esther Boardman (1762\u20131851) in deep shades of green and brown to highlight his sitter\u2019s striking face. Her alert gaze suggests intelligence, and her coiffure and wraparound dress, or levite, reveal her to be at the height of fashion, as was her brother, Elijah (whose portrait is also in the Museum's collection; 1979.395). The background shows the town of New Milford, which the Boardman family had been instrumental in settling.","61":"","62":"Early twentieth-century scholars identified this man with mutton-chop sideburns as C\u00e9zanne himself, but he is actually the artist\u2019s boyhood friend Gustave Boyer, a lawyer who sat for two other portraits around 1870\u201371. The painterly surface of this canvas, the liberal use of black and gray, and the boldly realized forms are typical of C\u00e9zanne\u2019s work at the time. ","63":"Madame Sophie was the sixth of eight daughters of Louis XV of France. Timid and self-effacing, she lived among members of the royal family at the ch\u00e2teaux of Bellevue and Versailles until her early death at forty-seven. She wears a magnificent dress of striped and flowered damask with a hair ornament of flowers and straps of the same material.","64":"This intense portrait depicts Fernando Ni\u00f1o de Guevara (1541\u20131609), who in 1596 was named cardinal and is dressed as such here. In 1599 he became Inquisitor General of Spain but resigned in 1602 to serve the rest of his life as Archbishop of Seville. The painting probably dates from the spring of 1600 when the cardinal was in Toledo with Philip III and members of the Madrid court. El Greco had lived in Venice and in the Farnese Palace in Rome, where Titian\u2019s portraits (such as those of the Farnese Pope Paul III) would have revealed to the Greek painter the psychological possibilities of portraiture.","65":"In this portrait the features of the greatest Venetian sculptor of the later sixteenth century, Alessandro Vittoria, are recorded by the greatest painter of his generation, Veronese. Vittoria is shown with the model for one of his most famous statues, the Saint Sebastian, carved in 1561\u201362 for the church of San Francesco della Vigna in Venice. This figure was later cast by Vittoria twice as a bronze statuette\u2014one of these belongs to the Metropolitan. Vittoria had portraits of himself holding his own sculpture painted by eminent artists at various times in his life; five were hung near the studio in his house where they could be seen by clients and visitors. This portrait was done around 1580 when the sitter was about fifty-five.","66":"Painted in Rome by one of the outstanding Venetian masters of the High Renaissance, this badly damaged portrait purports to show Christopher Columbus. The inscription identifies him as \"the Ligurian Colombo, the first to enter by ship into the world of the Antipodes 1519,\" but the writing is not entirely trustworthy and the date 1519 means that it cannot have been painted from life, as Columbus died in 1506. There are other, quite different, portraits that also claim to show Columbus. Nonetheless, from an early date our picture became the authoritative likeness. In 1814 the painting was part of the collection of Prince Talleyrand and was exhibited at the Palais Royal in Paris.","67":"Maharaja Sardar Singh (r. 1851\u201372) is captured here in an extraordinary portrait whose creator was undoubtedly aware of the inroads photography was making among royal patrons. At first glance, the work seems one of almost photographic realism. However, Chotu has carefully manipulated the painting's elements to play two and three-dimensional forms against one another, achieving a slightly surreal effect that is heightened by the composition's commanding symmetry, even down to the cleft beard and the bosses on the shield. The regularity is offset by the asymmetry of the pleated shawl and garment and by the fantastical turban, which is like some postmodern assemblage crowning the brooding visage.","68":"Suisse, a former artist\u2019s model, established an informal\u2014and extremely liberal\u2014art school in Paris which the young Courbet attended in the mid-1840s. By the time of this portrait, dated to 1861, Manet, Monet, and Pissarro had also studied at the Acad\u00e9mie Suisse. The sitter\u2019s spectacles and tousled gray hair indicate that he is getting on in age, but his gaze is sharp and animated; a fitting tribute to an early creative influence, painted the same year that Courbet opened a teaching studio of his own. ","69":"","70":"Richard Dana (1700\u20131772) was a justice of the province of Massachusetts and a leading figure of the Boston bar. During the early stages of the Revolution, the city depended on his sage legal advice. He was a member of the committee that investigated the Boston Massacre in 1770, at about the same time he posed for Copley. As a bold enhancement of the powerful portrait, Copley selected a carved-and-gilded Rococo frame. The frame is personalized with the Dana family\u2019s coat of arms: three stags separated by a chevron, with a fox at the crest and Cavendo tutus (\u201cBy caution secure\u201d) as the motto.","71":"Reynolds gave close attention to his portrait of George Kein Hayward Coussmaker, a lieutenant and captain in the first regiment of Foot Guards. No fewer than twenty-one appointments\u2014and at least two more for the sitter's horse\u2014are recorded between February 9 and April 16, 1782. The composition is complex and the whole vigorously painted.","72":"The noted baritone and collector Jean-Baptiste Faure posed for Manet in the winter of 1882\u201383. Among the artist's last canvases are this study and another (59.129) that were made in preparation for a portrait left unfinished at the time of Manet's death in April 1883.","73":"Hans Maler produced numerous portraits of members of the Fugger family, who by the sixteenth century had become one of Europe\u2019s greatest mercantile and banking dynasties. This painting shows Ulrich Fugger the Younger at age thirty-five, in the final year of his life, when he represented his family in the flourishing mining center of Schwaz in Tirol. A nearly identical version exists in a private collection. The Fuggers may have commissioned such relatively small portraits in multiples to distribute among family members and important business partners and to decorate the family\u2019s residences and offices. ","74":"","75":"A prodigious talent at fifteen, John Singleton Copley learned his trade by copying reproductions of Italian mythological paintings.  This charming juvenilia depicting Neptune and his retinue reminds us that Copley and the sitters in his later, mature portraits lived along the New England Coast and were deeply connected\u2014economically and psychologically\u2014to the sea.","76":"Charlotte, the daughter of Sir Francis Blake Delaval, married in 1776  Sir Robert Smith, Member of Parliament for Colchester. Their children are George Henry, Louisa, and Charlotte. Payments for this fashionable family portrait are recorded in March and May of 1787, and it was a popular exhibit at the Royal Academy the same year.","77":"The first American artist to enroll in the Royal Academy, London, Brown also studied under his compatriots Gilbert Stuart and Benjamin West. Brown remained in London for much of his career and enjoyed the peak of his success during the late 1780s, at about the time he painted this elaborate portrait. Like Copley, whose work he emulated, Brown surrounds his sitter\u2019s sharply defined face with loosely painted clothing, props, and background effects. He was well known for his complex portrayal of fabrics, as in ample evidence here.","78":"DeWitt Clinton (1769\u20131828) was born in New York and graduated from Columbia University in 1786. For many years he was a political power in city, state, and national affairs. Today, he is chiefly remembered for his sponsorship of the Erie Canal, but in his day he was also noted for his interest in legal reform and public education. This picture was painted and exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1826, when Clinton was governor of New York. Henry N. Dodge stated that it was painted for his father-in-law, Moseley I. Danforth, an engraver who planned to make and sell engravings of it. When he failed to attract sufficient subscribers, however, he abandoned the project. The background of the painting shows an overall pattern of stars bearing the monogram \"C,\" each surrounded by a wreath. The portrait is an eclectic combination of American and French styles, with its Trumbullesque pose and French patterning and color contrasts.","79":"Several artists ventured portraits of Mathilde Desportes, including the popular academician Jean-Jacques Henner (1829\u20131905), but her husband, Auguste Cuoq, found most of them unacceptable. This likeness was among those he rejected, reportedly because he felt that it did not adequately convey his wife\u2019s beauty. Courbet appears to have finished the picture to his own satisfaction in 1857, the date he assigned it in the catalogue of the solo exhibition he mounted in Paris in 1867. ","80":"A pendant Portrait of a Woman is in the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin.","81":"This portrait has an unusual oak frame that appears to have been constructed by a cabinetmaker rather than a traditional framemaker. It was likely made to match the furnishings and architectural details of a room in the sitter\u2019s home. Jane Crane Andrews (1840\u20131930), seen here around the time of her marriage, was later a member of the board of the Woman's Hospital and the National Society of Colonial Dames. Her husband, William, was a trustee of The Metropolitan Museum of Art and organized its library in 1880.","82":"Although this boy\u2019s identity remains a mystery, his portrait endows him with attributes of his family\u2019s position in colonial society. His beautiful embroidered coat indicates wealth and privilege, and the deer behind him is an emblem of longevity and discipline.","83":"Showing Charles IX around age eleven, wearing the Ordre de Saint-Michel, this portrait is derived from a drawing of the king by Fran\u00e7ois Clouet in the Biblioth\u00e8que Nationale de France, Paris.","84":"The sitter is Marie Rinteau, who in 1748 had given birth to an illegitimate daughter, Marie Aurore, by the famous soldier and courtier Maurice de Saxe (1696\u20131750). Marie is remembered as the great-grandmother of the writer George Sand (1840\u20131876). Marie and her sister Genevi\u00e8ve enjoyed a brief moment of success in music and theatre and long careers as cultured courtesans, known as \"les demoiselles de Verri\u00e8res.\"","85":"","86":"Although the present painting entered the Museum as a work of Van Dyck, the reserved expression of the sitter and the meticulous handling of the details of the costume are characteristic of de Vos's work. This highly respected Antwerp portrait painter is known for his dignified portraits which nevertheless maintain a charming modesty. He particularly excelled in group portraits of children.","87":"Once ascribed to Jacques Louis David, this engaging image of a young woman artist in a white dress is attributed to Marie Denise Villers. Although she is little known today, Villers was a gifted pupil of Anne Louis Girodet-Trioson (1767\u20131824), and, if the present portrait is by her, it was exhibited in the Paris Salon of 1801.","88":"The clever balance of verisimilitude and idealization in the features of this pair made Hans Memling the most sought-after portraitist of his day. The Florentine Tommaso Portinari was the branch manager of the Medici bank in Bruges, and probably commissioned these portraits from Memling upon the couple\u2019s marriage in 1470. They originally formed a triptych with a central devotional image of the Virgin and Child. Beyond demonstrating the couple\u2019s piety, Maria\u2019s elaborate necklace and gown display their wealth and social status. Memling places the sitters before illusionistic frames, an innovation suggesting that the figures project into our space.","89":"","90":"The broad brushwork is a hallmark of Kneller\u2019s style. The sitter (1620-1726, presuming he is correctly identified as the Duke of St. Albans), was the illegitimate son of Charles II by the actress Nell Gwynn.","91":"While there is no doubt of Copley's innate talent, these portraits give new meaning to the term precocious. About the age of fifteen, with no formal training and very little art to study, Copley not only could paint but also knew that his patrons would be best served with accurate but richly embellished likenesses. The handsome siblings, offspring of John and Priscilla Brown Greenleaf of Boston, wear just the sort of elaborate, inventive costumes that became the artist's forte. Copley's source for John's (2002.611) exotic cap and the boy's pose was a print after Sir Godfrey Kneller's portrait of Lord Bury as a child.","92":"","93":"The artist, his wife Helena, and one of their sons appear within an idealized version of the garden at Rubens\u2019s mansion in Antwerp, which survives to this day. The leather strap across Rubens\u2019s chest alludes to his right, as a nobleman, to carry a sword, while the rhyming ribbon tied across his son\u2019s chest playfully positions him as his father\u2019s heir. There was a nearly forty-year age gap between Rubens and his second wife, whom contemporaries widely recognized as his muse and the model for paintings such as the Venus and Adonis also in this gallery. The juxtaposition of her plump and pearlescent young hand with his ruddy and weathered one emphasizes both their physical disparities and their erotic connection.","94":"This sober image of the artist's father was painted in the year Heemskerck left Haarlem for an extended trip to Italy. The inscription on the parapet reads, \"My son portrayed me here when I had lived seventy-five years so they say.\" Departing from his usual classicizing style, the artist reverted to vernacular Dutch in Gothic letters, declaring this a portrait grounded in life and experience. A direct gaze confronts the viewer with the presence of a stern man nearing the end of his life. Three years later, Van Veen died at the age of seventy-nine, while Heemskerck was still abroad.","95":"Both Gros and G\u00e9rard were favored students in the rough and tumble fraternity that was the atelier of Jacques Louis David. Intense friendships and rivalries developed there. Gros probably made this sensitive and delicate portrait in Paris before G\u00e9rard departed for study in Rome in 1790. Despite the subsequent rift in their friendship, G\u00e9rard kept his portrait for the rest of his life, and it remained with his descendants until recently.","96":"This sensitive portrait on copper is one of Rubens\u2019s earliest known works. The square and dividers may refer to architecture or geography, while the watch is a reminder of mortality.","97":"Corsican by birth, Moltedo was an enterprising businessman and inventor, agent to the French clergy at the Vatican, and director of the Roman post office from 1803 until 1814. Painted during one of the most productive periods of Ingres\u2019s nascent career, this refined portrait belongs to a series of commissions he received from French officials in Napoleonic Rome. They are distinguished by the inclusion of Roman views as backdrops\u2014in this case the Appian Way and the Colosseum\u2014as well as by stormy gray skies, a Romantic conceit that serves as a foil to the calm and secure expressions of the men portrayed. ","98":"The sitter (1768-1795) was the daughter of Daniel Scott. The portrait memorializes her death.","99":"Giacomo Ceruti, nicknamed \"Pitocchetto\" (the little beggar), is still an enigmatic personality. His fame rests upon his numerous portraits and genre paintings. As his sobriquet implies, these often portray figures from the lower classes and seem to have enjoyed a widespread popularity among amateurs throughout northern Italy. Our painting is typical both in the social class of the subject, probably a maidservant carrying her mistress's dog, and its direct, unidealized presentation.","100":"In the autumn of 1866, C\u00e9zanne undertook a series of paintings of his maternal uncle, Dominique Aubert, in different costumes. Here, he dons a robe and tasseled blue cap. In another work in The Met\u2019s collection, he poses as a monk (1993.400.1). A friend reported: \"Every day there appears a [new] portrait of him.\" C\u00e9zanne applied his paint directly with a palette knife on the coarsely woven canvas, giving these pictures what he called a \"gutsy\" character. ","101":"Born in Bohemia, Mengs became the most important painter in Dresden, Rome, and Madrid in the third quarter of the eighteenth century. Whereas Mengs's portraits of prominent sitters are notable for their delicacy, meticulous detail, and refined beauty, his self-portraits are essays in truthfulness. The discolored swelling on his forehead is a physical defect visible from about 1760; declining health forced him to leave his position as court painter at Madrid in 1769, though he returned there between 1774 and 1777. This self-portrait was painted in Madrid in 1776 and dispatched to Genoa; three other versions of lesser quality are known.","102":"It was not uncommon to depict portrait sitters in the guise of a vestal virgin: many young women were shown thus when they were about to marry. The vestals were Roman guardians of the hearth and house chosen for their youth and purity; hence the presence of what might have been a table but is instead a brazier. The gold-trimmed robe is not contemporary dress but a costume, and the way in which the young woman lifts the veil is typical for the subject.","103":"This is a memorial portrait of Rufus Morse Newhall, born October 17, 1847, in Lincoln, Massachusetts, to Martha J. and Francis Newhall. He died in 1849, when he was seventeen months and four days old. The locket was designed to hold two images.","104":"A native of Lille, Vaillant trained in Antwerp and by the mid-1650s was well established as a portraitist in Amsterdam. The artist is also known as a pioneer of mezzotint engraving. In Dutch and Flemish portraits, falcons usually refer to hunting as an aristocratic sport.","105":"The identity of this reserved sitter, who seems warily to assess us with a sidelong glance, is unknown and the attribution to Vel\u00e1zquez has been much disputed. A reconsideration based on a detailed technical examination suggests that it may have been painted in Rome by Vel\u00e1zquez at the same time as the portrait of the artist\u2019s enslaved assistant, Juan de Pareja. In Rome, Vel\u00e1zquez portrayed people of various ranks and professions, ranging from the pope and cardinals to the pope\u2019s barber and people such as Juan de C\u00f3rdoba, who aided Vel\u00e1zquez in the purchase of works of art for the Spanish royal collection.","106":"Young art students Carolus-Duran and Fantin met while copying masterpieces at the Louvre about 1855. Carolus-Duran celebrated their friendship in two pictures of 1861: this likeness of twenty-five-year-old Fantin, and a closely related portrait (Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris). Fresh and penetrating, the present portrayal reveals the talents that made Carolus-Duran a rising star. Employing striking tonal contrasts and bold brushwork, he demonstrated his allegiance to the daring styles championed by Courbet and Manet. However, Carolus-Duran would soon temper his approach; he became a fashionable society portraitist and teacher, counting among his pupils John Singer Sargent (1856\u20131925).","107":"An inscription on the back of the canvas indicates that Badger painted this portrait of his three-year-old grandson, James (1757\u20131817). Largely self-trained and influenced by British print sources, Badger presented his young sitter with a compelling directness and honesty. The fashionably attired boy is shown standing in a generalized landscape setting, with cherries in his right hand and a bird perched on the index finger of his left.","108":"Courbet made this painting during an 1858 trip to Brussels intended to cultivate a Belgian market for his work. It was commissioned as a betrothal portrait by the sitter\u2019s fianc\u00e9, a doctor originally from Germany who belonged to progressive political circles, like Courbet himself. Shown in Antwerp in the summer of 1858, the picture earned praise for its forthright portrayal of a woman who was not conventionally beautiful, but seemed \"strong-willed . . . and full of spirit.\" The painting remained in the sitter\u2019s family until it was purchased in 1907, at the recommendation of Mary Cassatt, by Louisine and H.O. Havemeyer.","109":"Murer was an artist, celebrated pastry cook, restaurateur, novelist, poet, and avid collector of Impressionist paintings. By 1887, ten years after he sat for this portrait, he had amassed some 122 works by his painter-friends, including 15 by Renoir, whom he called \"the greatest artist of our century.\" It has been suggested that Murer\u2019s pose and gaze in this work served as a model for Van Gogh\u2019s famous portrait of another great Impressionist collector, Dr. Paul-Ferdinand Gachet (private collection), Murer\u2019s neighbor in Auvers.","110":"Some of the most distinguished female portraits produced in Florence in the third quarter of the fifteenth century seem to have originated in the workshop of Antonio and Piero del Pollaiuolo. The present portrait is ascribed to Piero del Pollaiuolo on the strength of its similarity to six panels of Virtues painted for the Mercanzia. The paint surface is much damaged, and the background, the dress, and the surrounding frame have been extensively restored.","111":"Daniel Crommelin Verplanck (1762\u20131834) was born in New York and spent the early part of his life in the family home on lower Wall Street. He was the eldest son of Judith Crommelin and Samuel Verplanck (39.173). While attending Columbia College (formerly King's College), he married Elizabeth Johnson, daughter of the president of Columbia. They had two children. Following her death in 1789, Verplanck married Ann Walton, with whom he had seven children. They lived on Wall Street until 1803 and then moved to Fishkill-on-Hudson, New York. He represented Dutchess County in Congress from 1803 until 1809. The portrait was painted in 1771 when Daniel was nine years old. The background has traditionally been identified as a view from the Verplanck country house at Fishkill, looking toward Mount Gulian.","112":"The son of Leonello d'Este, ruler of Ferrara, Francesco received his education at the court of Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. The hammer and ring may be jousting prizes or symbols of power, and the unusual white background could refer to the Este family\u2019s livery colors (white, red, and green). Rogier van der Weyden was one of the most influential painters of the fifteenth century. The elegant, stylized lines of the sitter\u2019s face and hands are among the qualities that established Rogier\u2019s supremacy as a court portraitist in the Netherlands.Reverse:The Este family coat of arms and crest on the reverse of the panel emphasize the heraldic quality of the portrait. The inscription, \"v[ot]re tout\u2026francisque\" (entirely yours, Francesco), forms a dedication to the portrait\u2019s recipient, perhaps a friend or member of Philip the Good\u2019s court. The \"m\" and \"e\" stand for \"marchio estensis,\" the title extended to Francesco. The enigmatic scratched inscription in the upper left, \"non plus \/ courcelles,\" may refer to the village in Burgundy where Francesco died.","113":"Hans Maler worked as a portrait painter in the mining town of Schwaz, just east of Innsbruck. The Schwaz silver works belonged to the most prosperous in Europe, and Sebastian Andorfer, who is shown in this portrait at the age of forty-eight, was one of its leading officials. As Silberbrenner (refiner of silver) he was responsible for guaranteeing the purity of Schwaz silver, a major source of income for the Habsburg Archduke Ferdinand and the Fugger family of Augsburg, whose likenesses Hans Maler also painted. ","114":"Painted in the winter of 1882\u201383, this study of the baritone Jean-Baptiste Faure was one of three executed in preparation for a portrait left unfinished when Manet died a few months later. Earlier, Manet had painted a full-length portrait of the singer in the role of Hamlet (Folkwang Museum, Essen), which drew adverse criticism when it was shown in the Salon of 1877; Faure, who owned many paintings by Manet, refused to accept it.","115":"This portrait of Samuel Verplanck (1739\u20131820) is unsigned and undated but can be assigned to 1771, when Copley made his sole trip to New York. The artist also painted Samuel Verplanck\u2019s brother Gulian as well as his son, Daniel Crommelin Verplanck.","116":"The \"beautiful Irishwoman\" depicted in this painting is Joanna Hiffernan (born 1842\/43), mistress and model of the artist James McNeill Whistler (1834\u20131903), and perhaps subsequently Courbet\u2019s lover. Although dated 1866, the picture was likely undertaken in 1865, when the two men painted together at the French seaside resort of Trouville; Courbet wrote of \"the beauty of a superb redhead whose portrait I have begun.\" He would paint three repetitions with minor variations. ","117":"This grand, allegorically rich portrait of Sully's daughter Jane Cooper Sully Darley (1807-1877) and her son Francis Thomas Sully Darley (d.1914) has provoked many interpretations, the most ambitious of which equates mother and son with the mythological figure of Penelope, the ideal wife of Odysseus, and Telemachus, her perfect son. Sully filled the composition with attributes of blithe family life: the spray of ivy clinging to the wall is the emblem of a faithful wife; the scene on the urn--Hermes bringing the infant Dionysus to be nurtured by the nymphs--alludes to the duties of motherhood; the boy's foot lightly resting on his dog connotes fidelity and loyalty.","118":"It has been argued that this may be the \"portrait of Diego, clothes to be finished\" listed in an inventory of the artist's possessions. The sitter relates to a figure in Vel\u00e1zquez's Surrender of Breda (Museo del Prado, Madrid). Scholars have questioned whether the painter would have dared to include himself as a bystander at such a historic military victory, and the surviving evidence suggests that he rarely made studies for his larger works. However, if the figure in that composition is the artist, a preparatory step such as this would have made it easier for Vel\u00e1zquez to transfer his likeness to that large painting.","119":"Two pages attend to the armor of a high-ranking officer, whose identity remains unknown. Pairing African and European servants was a regular conceit in sixteenth-century Italian painting. Here, the black youth who holds the helmet may have been intended to evoke a pun: the word morione (an armored headpiece) resembles that of moro (Moor). This painting belongs to a long history of military portraits, but the extensive landscape, with stormy skies over the advancing armies, and melancholic mood are unique to Bordon. It was much esteemed in the seventeenth century when it was sold to Cardinal Leopoldo de\u2019 Medici.","120":"The artist, born near Frankfurt and trained in Rome, moved to England in 1760. Patronized by George III and Queen Charlotte, in 1768 he was nominated by the king to the newly established Royal Academy. This small, precisely painted whole length of a man in clerical dress is the first work by Zoffany to enter the Museum's collection. ","121":"The picture is an autograph replica of a work (location unknown) that is fully signed and dated 1766 and was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1767. A critic of the Salon described that first version as a portrait of a boy with an ebony-colored dog with jet black eyes. In general, portraits of children by Drouais were preferred to those representing adults.","122":"Preserved on a label found on the back of this picture are excerpts from a letter dated December 6, 1884, in which Jane Stuart, the artist's youngest daughter, wrote of the work and her father, \"He painted a small sketch of himself for my mother (in London after great persuasion) but could not be induced to finish it.\" This suggests that the portrait was painted when Stuart was about age thirty, shortly after his marriage to Charlotte Coates on May 10, 1786. Stuart's sketchily indicated tousled hair and sunken eyes emphasize both his proud and irritable character and his working method.","123":"","124":"This sympathetic portrayal of an elderly man once formed a diptych with a portrait of an old woman (Museum of Fine Arts, Houston). Unlike the portraits of Tommaso and Maria Portinari displayed nearby, the two pictures were not parts of a devotional painting but were created with the idea of preserving the appearances of the sitters as they neared the end of their lives, a function of portraiture that became increasingly popular in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.","125":"This painting combines the domestic intimacy and descriptive richness of Dutch and Flemish art, which Jabach collected and admired, with the measured formal organization and allegorical allusions characteristic of French portraiture. Everhard Jabach (1618\u20131695), dressed in black, is seated in the company of his wife and their four children. Although Le Brun presents an arresting portrayal of each sitter, much of the composition is given over to Jabach and the emblems of his cultural interests and, through the artist\u2019s reflection in the mirror, his association with France\u2019s leading painter. Le Brun\u2019s canvas must have been executed around 1660, which also coincides with the construction of his grand new Parisian house.","126":"When exhibited at the National Academy of Design in 1830, Ingham's \"Portrait of a Little Girl with Flowers\" attracted critical scorn for its crisp handling, smooth modeling, and bright light on the figure\u2014the very tenets of contemporary neoclassicism. An Irish painter who must have studied in Paris before coming to New York, Ingham espoused the French neoclassical ideal while others clung to the popular, painterly British model. For this avant-garde portrait, Ingham found a willing subject in Amelia Palmer (1819\u20131843), the daughter of a Stonington, Connecticut, merchant. The idyllic setting and her sprite-like pose suggests that the artist aimed his artistic ambitions higher than straightforward portraiture. The wildflowers\u2014cotton grass, bull thistles, phlox, violets, silkweeds, milkworts, and pinks\u2014redouble the notion of the girl as classical wood nymph, a fair maiden who guards the place she inhabits.","127":"Beautiful and stylish, Serena Pulitzer Lederer was a star of turn-of-the-century Viennese society. For this portrait, commissioned by her husband, the industrialist August Lederer, Klimt employed soft, sinuous brushstrokes to present Serena as an apparition in white. \"An upright flower, long-stemmed \u2026 like a black tulip,\" enthused one critic when the painting was shown in 1901 at the tenth exhibition of the Vienna Secession\u2014a group founded by Klimt and other artists four years earlier, with the aim of putting the city at the forefront of the international art world. The Lederers subsequently formed the finest collection of Klimt\u2019s work in private hands. ","128":"Hans S\u00fcss von Kulmbach had been apprenticed to the Italian painter and printmaker Jacopo de\u2019 Barbari, who worked at a number of German courts in the first decade of the sixteenth century. The latter\u2019s influence must have continued even after Kulmbach joined D\u00fcrer\u2019s Nuremberg studio in 1507, since this portrait of an unidentified young man, which dates from about 1508, is stylistically very close to Barbari's earlier Portrait of a Man (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). The panel is unique in Kulmbach\u2019s oeuvre, as it joins a portrait with an allegorical subject on the verso. Reverse label: This charming genre depiction represents a girl making a garland of forget-me-nots, one of which lies on the windowsill. A decoratively trailing banderole above reads, in translation, \"I bind with forget-me-nots.\" Symbolizing a lover or prospective bride, the young maiden seems to address the young man who appears on the other side of the panel, promising to bind her heart faithfully to him. The prominently placed cat\u2014a symbol of respectable, constant love in the art of the period\u2014 also refers to her commitment and affection.","129":"This intimate portrait probably represents a sister of Helena Fourment, Rubens\u2019s second wife and the youngest of the Antwerp silk merchant Daniel Fourment\u2019s seven daughters. Most scholars favor an identification with Susanna Fourment, who married Arnold Lunden in 1622. Another Rubens portrait is thought to depict Clara Fourment (born 1593) and reveals a family resemblance. The veil, similar to a Spanish mantilla, was shifted by Rubens in the course of work and its earlier contours have become visible over time.","130":"Peto\u2019s numerous \u201crack\u201d pictures were often commissioned, and many contain clues to the identities of their original owners in the objects stuck behind the crisscrossed tape. In this example, a postcard and an envelope are clearly addressed to Dr. Bernard Goldberg, a chiropodist and a neighbor of Peto\u2019s in Philadelphia. The doctor may well have asked the artist to make the painting. Among the items depicted is a portrait, presumably of the doctor, perhaps representing an actual photograph taken by Peto. As seen here, Peto strove for decorative effects of color and texture and was less interested in illusionistic realism than was William Michael Harnett.","131":"This magnificent double portrait dates to 1788, when the artist was the standard-bearer of French Neoclassicism. For political reasons, Lavoisier was obliged to withdraw it from the 1789 Salon, and it was not exhibited for a century. Lavoisier was a chemist and famous for his pioneering studies of gunpowder, oxygen, and the chemical composition of water. In 1789 he published a chemistry textbook illustrated by his wife. Despite his services to both the monarchy and the revolutionary regime, he was guillotined.","132":"Holbein painted this small roundel about 1532\u201335, after his return to England. The young sitter can be identified as a court official, for he wears the livery of Henry VIII, with the initials H[R] for Henricus Rex embroidered in black on his red coat. The frame is original and the reverse is painted black and decorated with engraved circles. It is possible that the portrait, which is in excellent condition, originally had a protective painted lid. Such intimate portrait capsules were easily portable, as well as more affordable than larger-scale likenesses.","133":"Mrs. Shurlock was the mother of Robert Shurlock, the artist's son-in-law. This portrait of her taking snuff is one of several pastels made by Russell for his daughter's family. The handling of the sitter's face is smooth and even, while her bonnet and dress reveal a more rigorous application of the medium with greater evidence of the artist's stroke.","134":"","135":"Henrietta Isabella Sommers (1750\u20131783) was the daughter of Humphrey Sommers, a successful building contractor in Charleston, South Carolina. She was married to John Dart (67.268.1). The costume in this portrait was probably based on a print, since it is unlikely that Mrs. Dart possessed an ermine-trimmed robe. Theus undoubtedly painted the face from life and the clothing in his studio, with a mezzotint before him.","136":"","137":"The sitter of this arresting portrait remains unknown, but he was part of Bronzino\u2019s close circle of literary friends in Florence and probably holds a book of poetry. The artist was himself a poet, delighting as much in the beauty of language as he did in the witty and fanciful details of his paintings. Here, viewers would have appreciated the carved grotesque heads on the table and chair, and the almost hidden, masklike face suggested in the folds of the youth\u2019s breeches as comments on masks and disguises. Bronzino has delineated a sophisticated visual identity for his sitter.","138":"Durand wished to paint historical subjects but settled for portraits, advertising that \u201chis humble attempts, in which his best Endeavours will not be wanting, will meet with Acceptance, and give satisfaction.\u201d This portrait most likely portrays Susannah, the wife of Peter Bontecou, who was also painted by Durand. It may, though, be a portrait of his sister, Mary.","139":"Traditionally attributed to Veronese, to whose late work it is closely related, the portrait is now ascribed to his imitator and assistant, Francesco Montemezzano. The sitter is unidentified.","140":"The young Van Dyck presents himself as a courtly gentleman, with no reference to his profession other than the painting itself. The portrait probably dates from the artist\u2019s stay in London during the winter of 1620\u201321, and certainly before he left his native Antwerp for Italy in autumn 1621. That Van Dyck\u2019s family dealt in fine fabrics partly explains his predilection for rich attire (which was remarked upon by Bellori, an early biographer) and perhaps his elegant descriptions of drapery.","141":"The sitter (1792-1871) was a landscape and portrait painter. This work is a replica of another miniature of Morton signed by Rogers and dated 1829 (New York Historical Society).","142":"In August 1910 MacCameron noted in his journal that he had visited \"Rodin, the greatest of sculptors\u2014he is a charming person\u2014a splendid big head, with light grey warm creamy hair and beard. . . . I am [interested] in the idea of painting a good portrait of [him].\" The likeness, completed by late September, shows the sculptor holding a model of his iconic work The Thinker. Rodin and MacCameron discussed sending the portrait to The Met, but it traveled instead to New York's Academy of Design and Pittsburgh's Carnegie Institute. Collector and financier J. Pierpont Morgan aquired it and, in 1912, he gave it to The Met, where it hung in a new gallery dedicated to Rodin.","143":"The wealth and elevated social status of this Elizabethan woman is suggested by her elaborate dress and  jewels. Reflecting the influence of paintings by Nicholas Hilliard, this portrait and another of the same sitter at Parham Park in Sussex may be dated about 1600.","144":"Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres, the neo-classical French artist par excellence, painted this masterpiece toward the end of his life when his reputation as a portraitist to prominent citizens and Orl\u00e9anist aristocrats had been long established. Pauline de Broglie sat for the artist\u2019s final commission. Ingres captures the shy reserve of his subject while illuminating through seamless brushwork the material quality of her many fine attributes: her rich blue satin and lace ball gown, the gold embroidered shawl, and silk damask chair, together with finely tooled jewels of pearl, enamel, and gold. The portrait was commissioned by the sitter\u2019s husband, Albert de Broglie, a few years after their ill-fated marriage. Pauline was stricken with tuberculosis soon after completion of the exquisite portrait, leaving five sons and a grieving husband. Through Albert\u2019s lifetime, it was draped in fabric on the walls of the family residence. The portrait remained in the de Broglie family until shortly before Robert Lehman acquired it.","145":"Painted just after Rembrandt\u2019s arrival in Amsterdam, this well-preserved portrait reveals the talent that enabled the young artist to quickly make a name for himself in the Dutch Republic\u2019s largest and most artistically competitive city. The oval format was fashionable at the time, and the linen folds of the man\u2019s ruff offered Rembrandt the chance to display his signature vigorous brushwork. Nothing is known about the man\u2019s identity, and the inscription giving his age as forty is most likely by a later hand.","146":"The sitters are the artist's immediate family: his wife, Elizabeth Osborne (who wears a miniature self-portrait of Henri); daughters, Elizabeth and Henrietta; and son, Peter.","147":"This depiction of Daoist deities was once part of a set of paintings used in the Buddhist water-and-land ritual and commissioned by the emperor, as attested to by the inscription in the lower left: \"By imperial order, directed and supervised by the senior eunuchs of the Directorate of the Imperial Household Service, Shang Yi, Wang Qin, and others.\" The identity of the deities is given in a second inscription, written in gold, along the right-hand margin: \"Portrait of the Northern Dipper, Central Dipper, and Root Destiny Star Lords.\" According to the scholar Shawn Eichman, there are five \"dipper\" constellations in Daoist astronomy, with the Central Dipper as the leader and the Northern Dipper responsible for removing names from the records of death. In this depiction, the seven star gods of the Central Dipper are shown in the lower register wearing regal robes and crowns, while the nine stars of the Northern Dipper, including two hidden stars, wear less formal robes and occupy the middle register. Eichman identifies the small figure with two attendants at the upper right as the Root Destiny Officer, who descends to earth to accept offerings on the cyclical anniversary of each person's birth (see Stephen Little with Shawn Eichman, Taoism and the Arts of China [Chicago: The Art Institute of Chicago, 2000], p. 248).","148":"In eighteenth-century Europe, Paris led the production of high-quality luxury goods. Parisian goldsmiths made a wide range of small, personal articles such as snuffboxes; \u00e9tuis to hold sealing wax, tweezers, or utensils for sewing; souvenirs, which contained thin ivory tablets for note taking; and shuttles for knotting lace. Gold snuffboxes and boxes decorated with portrait miniatures were prized and frequently given as royal gifts, often to ambassadors or members of the court in lieu of cash payments for their services. Coveted and admired, these boxes were produced from a variety of materials. The best were skillfully made of gold and embellished with diamonds, enameled decoration, lacquer, and other luxurious materials. By the middle of the century, the taking of snuff had become an entrenched social ritual, and the snuffbox, too, had become an important social prop. Snuffboxes were considered highly fashionable accessories, with some merchants advertising new boxes with each change of season. The popularity of snuffboxes extended to all levels of society, and for those who could not afford gold, boxes were produced in less expensive materials such as silver, tortoiseshell, porcelain, or domestically produced lacquer.","149":"Herman Doomer was a successful cabinetmaker who worked with the imported ebony fashionable in seventeenth-century Amsterdam. The exceptional care Rembrandt took with this likeness may indicate his esteem for a fellow master artisan. At roughly the same time Rembrandt painted the portrait of Doomer and a companion piece of his wife (State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg), the couple\u2019s son Lambert was an apprentice in the artist\u2019s studio.","150":"This double portrait of a married couple attired as typical German burghers might represent the Augsburg merchant Lorenz Kraffter and his wife, Honesta Merz, whose birthdates (1460 and 1477, respectively) correspond to the sitter\u2019s ages inscribed on the painting in 1512. As double portraits are relatively rare, it is noteworthy that three versions of this painting exist, all attributed to the Augsburg painter Ulrich Apt the Elder and his workshop. The present work, which is considered to be the initial version, most likely was intended for the couple\u2019s private home, while the copies may have been made for family members. ","151":"The man is most likely Cornelis van Beresteyn (1586\u20131638), a wealthy burgomaster of Delft. His restrained pose and sober expression contrast with the animation and accessibility that Rembrandt usually attributed to members of Amsterdam society. At the time, portraits in Delft and in the neighboring court city of The Hague were remarkably conservative, adhering to a tradition that went back to Spanish royal portraits of the mid-1500s. Rembrandt is known to have painted a few portraits in The Hague during 1632.","152":"","153":"Sarto was known as \"the painter without defects.\" His figures are masterfully drawn, beautifully colored, and composed with an air of nobility. Giovanni Borgherini commissioned this grand Holy Family during the short-lived rule of Florence as a Republic before the Medici family was reinstated violently and permanently as its rulers. Sarto expressed the political meaning through the imagery of Christ holding the orb, suggesting his exclusive kingship\u2014a known symbol of the Republic.","154":"John Durand completed a series of children\u2019s portraits in New York in 1766. The identification of the young sitter rests on a long tradition in the Crossfield family. The open book in the boy\u2019s hand and the volumes on the shelf behind him are surely meant to affirm the importance of liberal education in colonial times. The massive column rising in the background heightens the elegance of the youthful figure, and the flashing light on the drapery and the table cover draws attention to the opulence of the setting.","155":"In eighteenth-century Europe, Paris led the production of high-quality luxury goods.

Like many of his business associates, he was an enthusiastic collector of art. One of the finest paintings in his collection was this commissioned group portrait showing three generations of his family. It depicts them in the library of their New York residence at 49 Park Avenue, on the northeast corner of 39th Street. Hatch is seated to the right at his desk, and his wife, the former Theodosia Ruggles (1829\u20131908), leans on the mantel. Other members of the family, including Theodosia's mother, Hatch's father, and their children are also present.","157":"The sitter (1813-?), who lived in Poughkeepsie, probably had his portrait painted around the time of his marriage on May 20, 1841, to Isabella Montgomery.","158":"Eug\u00e9nie Zerban (1803-1880) married Florent \u00c9douard Simon, a lawyer, in 1823. The couple was living in St. Martinsville, Louisiana, when the portrait was painted.","159":"Following Napoleon\u2019s defeat at the battle of Waterloo in 1815, Jacques Louis David, a leading figure in the French revolution and first painter to the Emperor, went into exile in Brussels. There he painted General G\u00e9rard, a commander in the French army and a member of the imperial aristocracy who had also settled temporarily in the Belgian capital. This portrait is among the first David painted abroad and it is remarkable for its clear, bright color and sharp realism.","160":"On January 18, 1779, the Supreme Executive Council of Pennsylvania passed a resolution commissioning a portrait of George Washington for the Council Chamber and selected Charles Willson Peale as the artist. In preparation, Peale traveled to the Princeton and Trenton battlefields in February of 1779 to make sketches for the background. The original portrait, the full-length version now in  the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, was a tremendous success and Peale completed numerous copies for royal palaces abroad, each time updating the general's military dress. This figure of George Washington was probably painted between June and August of 1780. In every other version, Washington is shown after the Battle of Princeton, but here he is depicted after the Battle of Trenton, the turning point of the war. It has been suggested that this portrait was commissioned upon the order of Mrs. Washington, because it is the only portrait in which Washington wears his state sword and because the painting descended in the Washington family.","161":"When he was eighteen, Rembrandt Peale painted a portrait of Washington from life in the presence of his father, Charles Willson Peale.  During the remainder of his career, Rembrandt demonstrated a near obsession with Washington and replicated this famous portrait seventy-nine times.  The stone oval derives from the seventeenth-century European fashion for tromp l'oeil stone casements, a format Peale may have observed during periods of study in Europe.","162":"In 1800 Robert Shurlock (1772\u20131847) married John Russell\u2019s daughter, Henrietta Ann Jane Russell (1775\u20131849), near the artist\u2019s house in Guildford, Surrey. This pastel was likely completed shortly after the marriage, and the companion portrait of Henrietta with the couple\u2019s first child is also in this gallery. Here Mr. Shurlock is a dashing man at the height of his youth, wearing a silk neck scarf and a double-breasted coat with brass buttons. The artist executed several other portraits for his daughter\u2019s family, all dating to 1801.","163":"Born in Philadelphia, Benbridge studied in London and in Rome under Anton Raphael Mengs and Pompeo Batoni.  In 1772, the artist settled in Charleston, where he became the city's fashionable portraitist after Jeremiah Theus died in 1774.  This miniature exhibits Benbridge's colorful, linear, and crisply realistic portrait style, which is remarkably similar to that of John Singleton Copley. Dating from about 1770, it is one of the artist's earliest efforts in the medium, yet it shows more refinement than a number of his later works. The case, which is set with amethysts that match the gentleman's lavender waistcoat, is original to the piece.","164":"Charlotte, second daughter of Lieutenant General Sir John Clavering, married Sir Thomas Brooke-Pechell (1753\u20131826) in 1785. An inscription on the portrait's reverse records that it was painted in 1799. The pendant portrait of her husband is also in the Museum's collection.","165":"Wollaston\u2019s arrival in New York from London in 1749 introduced to the colonies a new style of portraiture characterized by rich, brightly colored fabrics and sprightly, informal poses. The prominent West Indian merchant William Axtell (1720\u20131795) ordered this portrait for the larger of his two New York homes: the country place called Melrose Hall in Flatbush, Long Island (now Brooklyn). During the Revolutionary War, Axtell was commissioned by the British as a colonel for the corps of Long Island Loyalists. His American holdings were confiscated in 1784, after he fled New York for England.","166":"The sitter (1783-1832) was the lawyer and civic leader in New  York City for whom Macomb's Dam across the Harlem River was named. This portrait is thought to date from the time of his marriage to Mary Cornell Pell.","167":"","168":"The portrait and history painter Washington Allston (1779-1843) lived and worked in Boston after a period of study in London.","169":"Corot painted fewer than fifty portraits. Most were made about 1830 and all depict his family and friends. Lemaistre, an architect, married Corot\u2019s niece Blanche Sennegon (d. 1846) in 1832.","170":"This small oil painting depicts an interaction between the artist Tintoretto and the literary critic and satirist Pietro Aretino, two cultural figures of sixteenth century Venice. The episode, real or apocryphal, was originally documented by Carlo Ridolfi in his Life of Tintoretto (1642). Ingres portrays the moment when Tintoretto feigns violence towards Aretino, whom he had invited to his studio to sit for a portrait. Aretino, shown in the pose of the martyr St. Francis receiving the stigmata, momentarily fears danger before recognizing the gesture as Tintoretto\u2019s playful revenge for Aretino\u2019s criticism of his work.Painted in 1848 for Marcotte Genlis, this picture is Ingres\u2019s second version of the subject, the original dating to 1815. Ingres frequently copied his own paintings in an effort to improve upon his representations of often unconventional narratives.","171":"For this portrait there are more than two dozen drawings investigating a variety of poses (Mus\u00e9e Ingres, Montauban). Similar studies do not exist for the likeness of Madame Leblanc\u2019s husband (19.77.1). The two paintings\u2014the only pair of portraits Ingres produced\u2014were probably intended to hang facing one another, since the light falls differently in each, but they are unified by the visual harmony of hands, gold chains, and rich textiles that enhance the couple\u2019s black clothing. This work, however, was exhibited without its pendant at the Salon of 1834.","172":"","173":"The sitter\u2019s identity is unknown, as in many Rembrandt portraits of the 1630s. During that decade in Amsterdam the painter was pressed with many portrait commissions, which he handled with the occasional use of assistants and different degrees of quality in his own work. Some critics detect the hand of a collaborator in this painting, but the strong modeling of the face, delicate drawing of the cap, and immediacy of the expression are typical of Rembrandt himself. ","174":"This young woman is revealed frankly in direct white light, her tiny, elaborate curls and gay light-blue mantle striking a somewhat discordant note with her somber eyes and large, strong face. In her ears she wears ball earrings and around her neck, a double-wound chain from which hangs a small golden figure. The texture of the encaustic medium, worked with brushes and tools, reveals the artist\u2019s careful shaping of the curves and dimensionality of the face. A date for this panel in the mid-first century A.D. is indicated by the sitter\u2019s hairstyle\u2014modeled on that of the Emperor Nero\u2019s mother, Agrippina\u2014as well as other features of the painting. The work belongs to the first generation of painted panel portraits, which only emerged as an Egyptian funerary style just before the mid-first century A.D., to continue for only approximately two hundred years. The delicately thin panels were attached over the faces of wrapped mummies, so that the curvature of the panel reflects this original use.  The pendant on the necklace has recently been identified as Omphale, a figure of Greek mythology whose liaison with Herakles gave her power over the womb and the travails of childbirth and, by extension, over rebirth after death.Link to the Artist ProjectY.Z. Kami on Egyptian mummy portraits","175":"","176":"","177":"Compared with Rembrandt's formal portraits of the same year, this picture is remarkable for its brilliant brushwork and dramatic illumination. It was probably painted shortly after he moved from his native Leiden to Amsterdam, and in its exotic subject and style was surely intended for a knowledgeable collector. Pictures of imaginary Persian, Ottoman, or otherwise \"Oriental\" princes were popular at the time because of new trade contacts between the Dutch and the Middle East. However, the model is a Dutchman who appears in other paintings by Rembrandt and by artists in his circle.","178":"This animated portrait has a pendant showing the sitter\u2019s husband rising from a chair (Taft Museum, Cincinnati). When seen together, husband and wife seem to respond to each other, making these among Rembrandt's most inventive compositions of the early 1630s. Rembrandt's early experience as a painter of dramatic history scenes and his close study of physiognomy and character during the time he spent in Leiden prepared him to be the most original and successful portraitist in Amsterdam, where he arrived in the winter of 1631\u201332.","179":"Jeremiah Platt (1744\u20131811) was a successful New York businessman, a partner with his brother-in-law Samuel Broome in the mercantile firm of Broome, Platt and Company. Mare, a little-known but highly skilled New York portraitist, painted an inventive and refined portrait of Platt, with as much attention paid to the Chippendale-style side chair as to the sitter.","180":"George William Fairfax of Virginia (1793-1853) married in 1816, the date of this portrait.","181":"Married in 1827, Ruth and Samuel Shute were a husband-and-wife team of itinerant portrait painters working in New England and upstate New York. Although they initially painted independently, the couple collaborated on a series of oil and watercolor portraits beginning in 1832. Little is known about the sitter, who is identified only by the calling card in her right hand. An inscription on the back reveals each artist\u2019s contribution to the work, which was \u201cDrawn by R.W. Shute and Painted by S. A. Shute.\u201d The couple characteristically mixed materials, combining graphite, watercolor, and applied gold foil, added here to emulate Miss Parker\u2019s jewelry.","182":"The Irish actress Elizabeth Farren made her London debut in 1777 as Kate Hardcastle in Oliver Goldsmith's She Stoops to Conquer. She was at the height of her career when this canvas was exhibited in 1790. Seven years later, she married the twelfth earl of Derby. This elegant portrait helped to secure for Lawrence the role of successor to the elderly Sir Joshua Reynolds (1723\u20131792). ","183":"Russell was England's leading pastellist in the later eighteenth century. He studied under Francois Cotes and from 1769 to 1806 exhibited annually at the Royal Academy, of which he was a member. This portrait and a companion piece showing the sitter's husband were executed to celebrate the couple's fortieth anniversary.","184":"Margaret Strachan (1747\u20131821) was the daughter of William Strachan of London Town in Anne Arundel County, Maryland. In 1772, she married Thomas Harwood, who served as treasurer of the Western Shore of Maryland from 1776 until his death in 1804. Although undated, this work was probably executed prior to the Strachans\u2019 marriage. It appears on a \u201cpayment due\u201d list compiled by Peale for the period 1770 to 1775. A companion portrait of Thomas Harwood was painted around 1775 and is now in the collection of the Winterthur Museum in Delaware.","185":"This group portrait includes the artist's companion, Kathleen Newton (1854\u20131882), at left; her children, Cecil George Newton (1876\u20131941) and Muriel Mary Violet Newton (1871\u20131933); and two unidentified figures. The setting appears to be Tissot's garden in St. John's Wood, London.","186":"Alfred Sully (1820-1879) was the artist's son. He sat for his father while a student at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. During the same period he also sat for an oil portrait.","187":"This is the earliest surviving double portrait in Italy, the first to show the sitters in a domestic setting, and the first with a view onto a landscape. The woman, dressed luxuriously ala francese, her sleeve embroidered with letters spelling \"lealta\" (faithful), is observed by a man\u2014her betrothed?\u2014appearing at a window, his hands on an identifying coat of arms. The two figures may be Lorenzo di Ranieri Scolari and Angiola di Bernardo Sapiti, who were married about 1439. Lippi\u2019s task was complicated by the Italian preference for the profile view as opposed to the three-quarter view preferred north of the Alps.","188":"","189":"A celebrated male soprano, Pasqualini is crowned by Apollo, who had been victorious in a musical contest with the satyr Marsyas (shown in the background, defeated and tied to a tree with his bagpipes beside him). Pasqualini joined the choir of the Sistine Chapel in 1630, and from 1632 was a protagonist in many operas produced at the Palazzo Barberini. Sacchi designed sets for some of these. The singer plays an upright harpsichord decorated with the figures of Daphne and a bound satyr; Apollo is loosely based on the famous ancient sculpture known as the Apollo Belvedere.","190":"Charles Coguin was the superior of the Benedictine monastery of Saint Sauveur d'Anchin, near Douai, from 1511 to 1547 and during his years there commissioned many works from Bellegambe. This portrait, which has been cut down at the top and bottom, was the left wing of a triptych.","191":"This conversation piece\u2014a group portrait with narrative elements\u2014was the first commissioned work of a type that Johnson would often paint. It shows William Tilden Blodgett (1823\u20131875), a supporter of the Union cause and a founding trustee of the Metropolitan Museum, with his family in the Renaissance Revival parlor of their house at 27 West 25th Street. Depicted during the Civil War, at a time of urban upheaval, the serene interior decorated for Christmas, embodies \"the best sentiment of home,\" as a critic observed in 1865. Only the toy of a caricatured black male dancer held by the young boy hints at pressing issues of racial strife and emancipation.","192":"","193":"John Dart (1750\u20131782), the son of Benjamin Dart, was a lawyer in Charleston, South Carolina. In 1772, he married Henrietta Sommers. This portrait and its companion picture (67.268.2) were probably painted around the time of the Dart\u2019s marriage. The elaborate coat and waistcoat date from the 1760s, but Theus often copied costumes for his sitters from mezzotints.","194":"The sitter (1789-1862) was the daughter of Matthew and Catharine Ridley. This may be her engagement portrait; she married Robert Watts in June 1811.","195":"This is a disguised portrait, in which the sitter is shown as Diana, goddess of the hunt, with her traditional attributes, the bow and the quiver of arrows. Her tightly coiffed and powdered hair worn with a small corsage of flowers was typical for the time.Owing to the appearance of a copy with the arms of both the sitter and her husband, it has recently become possible to identify her as Madame Bergeret de Frouville.","196":"This portrait of Leblanc and that of his wife (19.77.2) were painted in 1823, shortly after Ingres met the couple in Florence. Madame Leblanc had been lady-in-waiting to the Grand Duchess of Tuscany, Napoleon\u2019s sister \u00c9lisa Bacchiochi; Monsieur Leblanc was her secretary. Ingres described him as \"a Frenchman, very rich and also quite generous and good, who has adopted us, to the point of overwhelming us with kindnesses and also with requests for paintings portraits, etc.\" Edgar Degas, who first saw these portraits in 1854, described his acquisition of them in 1896 as \"the event of my life as a collector.\" The Metropolitan bought them from Degas\u2019s estate sale in 1918.","197":"Marie-Octavie Bernier was the wife of the commander of Renoir's regiment during the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u201371). In the spring of 1871, Renoir stayed with the couple, who were living with her father in the town of Tarbes in southwestern France. Enjoying their hospitality and a level of comfort that is reflected in this portrait, Renoir fondly recalled that he spent \"two months in a ch\u00e2teau,\" where he was \"treated like a prince,\" rode horses every day, and taught his hosts' daughter to paint.","198":"Juan Rodr\u00edguez Ju\u00e1rez was a versatile artist who excelled as a painter of altarpieces as well as portraits and small devotional works such as the Entombment of Christ. This work displays the brilliant color and vigorous modeling characteristic of the earliest phase of his career. The composition derives from a Flemish print, but the painter has altered it to heighten the impact of Christ\u2019s seminude body, which is presented as the focus of prayer and meditation. The artist\u2019s signature, conspicuously inscribed on the tomb, also signals his devotion.","199":"Renoir depicts the five-year-old daughter of his devoted patron Paul Berard, a diplomat and banker whom he met in 1878. The artist often summered at the Berards' country home in Wargemont, near Dieppe, on the Normandy coast, where he painted decorative pictures for the house and a veritable family album of portraits, ranging from formal commissions to more intimate works that reflect a genuine fondness for the four Berard children. According to Margot's nephew, Renoir painted this spirited portrait to \"cheer her up\" after a disagreeable lesson with her German tutor had brought her to tears. ","200":"","201":"Gaspar de Crayer painted several portraits of Philip IV, probably commissioned by the Marqu\u00e9s de Legan\u00e9s, who served as Philip\u2019s emissary to the Spanish court in Brussels in 1627\u201328. Here the young king of Spain is presented in a magnificently decorated Flemish cavalry armor. He holds a commander\u2019s baton in his right hand and wears an ornate rapier on his left hip. The composition follows a pattern in Spanish portraiture of depicting kings in fine armor, which was established decades earlier by Titian, for example in his portraits of Emperor Charles V and King Philip II.","202":"","203":"","204":"Talleyrand commissioned this elegant informal image after he resigned from his position as minister of foreign affairs to protest Napoleon\u2019s continuing military ambitions. G\u00e9rard knew and received him personally in his studio: the imposing presence and unrevealing expression are typical. The insignia of the Legion d\u2019honneur is embroidered on Talleyrand's coat and across his waistcoat is the red sash of the Grand Cordon of the order, awarded in 1805. He also wears the emblem of the Golden Fleece, presented to him at the Congress of Vienna, and added to the picture by G\u00e9rard in or after 1815.","205":"The sitters for this portrait and its companion piece (2006.235.296) were sisters.","206":"This is one of several musical portraits painted by Guillaume Voiriot (1713-1799).  The guitar is similar to one in the Museum's collection attributed to Jean-Baptiste Voboam (1989.147)","207":"Steen often made himself the butt of his own jokes, placing his self-portrait at the center of domestic chaos. Here, the artist entwines his fingers with those of the maid, who pours his wife a generous serving of wine. Broken glass, a mischievous cat, and romping young boys contribute to the general impression of a household run amok. Suggestions of an ominous fate hang literally over the family\u2019s heads, in the form of a basket containing a beggar\u2019s crutch and can, as well as clappers, then used to warn of leprosy or the plague, and the jack of spades, signifying misfortune.","208":"","209":"Ad\u00e9la\u00efde Labille-Guiard was apprenticed to a miniaturist and later, in 1769, studied pastel with Maurice Quentin de La Tour. The rich palette and fine detail reflect her earlier training. In 1783, when she and Vig\u00e9e Le Brun were admitted to the French Acad\u00e9mie Royale, the number of women artists eligible for membership was limited to four, and this canvas has been interpreted as a propaganda piece, arguing for the place of women in the academy. Labille-Guiard sympathized with the Revolution and remained in France throughout her life.","210":"The United States Census of 1850 initiated the requirement that heads of households provide information about each of their dependents. The new regulation caused a good deal of confusion. Edmonds\u2019s humorous image, which is the earliest known portrayal of the census-taking process, features a father\u2019s painstaking efforts to recall his family statistics, while several of his children hide from sight. The small framed portrait of George Washington above the mantel evokes not only the genesis of the country\u2019s political system but also the legendary admonition never to tell a lie. The carefully lit interior and wealth of detail in the composition were inspired, in part, by earlier Dutch genre scenes.","211":"This portrait of Washington and the companion portrait of Martha Washington (2006.235.327) were probably reframed either in 1876, for the nation's centennial, or in 1889, for the centennial of Washington's inauguration.","212":"Russell was England's leading pastellist in the later eighteenth century. He studied under Francis Cotes and from 1769 to 1806 exhibited annually at the Royal Academy, of which he was a member. This portrait and a companion piece showing the sitter's wife were executed to celebrate the couple's fortieth anniversary.","213":"Peale executed this vivid portrait during a period of incessant experimentation with his paints. The artist, who was seeking stronger colors and bolder contrasts, realized those aims here, especially in the robust flesh tints and the fashionable costume. The change in palette as well as the direct gaze of his subject increased the realism of the work. The Philadelphia Windsor chair, with its green paint worn down to the grain, is convincingly rendered. Williams (1750\u20131822) was a quartermaster in the Maryland militia when he sat for Peale.","214":"This painting belongs to a group of portraits Hans Holbein made for the German merchants of the Hanseatic League in London (see also his Portrait of a Member of the Wedigh Family nearby). The bearded, thirty-year-old sitter is identified by the letter in his hand, which is addressed \"To the honorable and pious Derick Berck, London, at the Steelyard [. . .].\" The other inscription on the cartellino refers to a passage from Virgil\u2019s Aeneid that reads, \"[Perchance even this distress] will someday be a joy to recall.\" Exhorting perseverance, this statement might have been the sitter\u2019s personal motto.","215":"In Van Dyck\u2019s portrait, the pregnant queen of England cradles her arms over her abdomen while standing next to a crown that advertises her rank. Henrietta Maria commissioned this painting as a gift for Cardinal Francesco Barberini, who viewed the devout French-born queen as a critical collaborator in his dream of regaining England for the Catholic Church. Destined for a leading patron of the arts in Baroque Rome, Van Dyck\u2019s portrait was one of many diplomatic gifts that spread the artist\u2019s fame and influence throughout Europe.","216":"","217":"One of early America's great art patrons, the dry goods merchant Luman Reed of New York offered critical support to the careers of Durand, the landscape painter Thomas Cole, and the genre painter William Sidney Mount, and built a gallery in his house for the display of their work and that of the old masters. From Durand, Reed commissioned portraits of the nation's presidents and eventually encouraged the artist to abandon his original career as an engraver to become a painter. Still, he would not live to see Durand blossom as a landscape artist. Reed died untimely, just the year after the completion of this solid likeness. His passing was sorely mourned; Durand reminded Cole in a letter that Reed was \"the man whose equal we shall never see again.\" The artist did not exaggerate, but Reed's partner, Jonathan Sturges, for whom this portrait was painted, became an important patron in his own right of Durand, Cole, and their colleagues.","218":"This portrait of two adolescent scions of an eminent family was most likely commissioned by their widowed mother. Instead of depicting an actual country estate, Cuyp placed a ruined castle in the background, evoking the sitters\u2019 ancient lineage. Sitting astride horses, accompanied by retainers and hounds, the two youths pose as propertied huntsmen, ready at any moment to depart for the conquest of their prey. Cuyp\u2019s skill as a landscape painter is in tension with the relative awkwardness of the figures.","219":"The term encaustic designates painting in which beeswax is mixed with pigments. The technique was first used by Greek painters of the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. Ancient descriptions are difficult to interpret, and Egyptian mummy portraits--the only works in the medium surviving from antiquity--have not yet been analyzed extensively. Therefore, many questions concerning the details of the techniques used by mummy-portrait painters remain open, although the work of a few scholars and modern artists who paint in encaustic has provided some insight. The first step in producing a mummy portrait was to sketch the outlines of face and garment on a wood panel that had been prepared with distemper, transparent glue, or dark wax. Then, a mixture of beeswax with powdered pigments was prepared. The wax could be used hot or cold. When used in molten state, the wax was either pure or supplemented with resin, glue, egg, gum, or oil. The molten beeswax\/ pigment mixture was laid on quickly with long even brushstrokes, employing a thinner mixture for the background and garments and thick creamy paste-like paints for the facial features. When the wax cooled, a hard tool was used to blend the various flesh tones of face and neck. When used cold, the wax had to be made suitable for painting by a process called emulsification, in which alkalis were added that allowed the wax to be suspended in egg or oil. The ancient writers appear to refer to this as \"Punic wax.\" Emulsified wax paints are said to dry more slowly than molten wax paints, giving the painter greater control, and time to correct and adjust during the painting process. Mummy portraits that show only brushstrokes, no hard tool marks, are thought to have been created with emulsified cold wax.  Many modern artists who paint in encaustic actually employ a heated tool to fuse paints, hence the term encaustic, which means \"burnt in.\" Ancient painters probably did not use such a technique.Although the panel shape and palette of this painting and 09.181.2 are very similar, differences in the hair and beards suggest that the portrait of the man with the mole (09.181.2) is about a generation earlier than the portrait here. This man's body is turned more directly toward the viewer. He has bushy black hair, large round eyes, tawny skin, and a thick beard that emphasizes his emaciated cheeks. The use of light and shadow on various parts of the face and neck is very skilled.Link to the Artist ProjectY.Z. Kami on Egyptian mummy portraits","220":"Here the public views David's enormous painting of Napoleon crowning Empress Josephine, which was exhibited in the Louvre on three separate occasions in 1808\u201310. Its display was widely reported in the newspapers. A man in military garb reads the description to enable viewers to identify the various figures in David's picture, while Boilly scattered further portraits including his own, at far right, among the spectators. One of Boilly's most ambitious compositions, painted in 1810 it was exhibited at the Galerie Lebrun, Paris, in 1826, in the first posthumous retrospective of works by David and his school.","221":"Trained in Naples in the Netherlandish technique of oil painting, Antonello set the standard for portraiture when he came from Sicily to Venice in 1475. Long before Leonardo da Vinci, he introduced the incipient smile as an indication of the inner life of the sitter, enveloping his features in a soft light and engaging the viewer with his direct gaze. In these ways, the picture responds to the often-voiced negative view that painting was a mere depiction of the outward appearance of a person\u2014not his character.","222":"Hendrickje Stoffels, the daughter of a soldier, worked as Rembrandt\u2019s housekeeper, eventually becoming his common-law wife and mother of his daughter, Cornelia. While no formal portraits of Stoffels survive, she is believed to have modeled for a number of Rembrandt\u2019s paintings, including this work, perhaps intended as a generic image of a courtesan. The figure\u2019s intimate gesture of holding her robe closed with one hand echoes the close observations Rembrandt made of the women in his household in many surviving drawings.","223":"Rembrandt was a dedicated self-portraitist all his life, and roughly forty self-portraits by him survive today. In this example, painted when Rembrandt was fifty-four, the artist was unsparing in depicting the signs of aging in his own face, building up the paint in high relief to convey his furrowed brow, the heavy pouches beneath his eyes, and his double chin. The recent removal of a synthetic varnish has revealed more of Rembrandt\u2019s working method, showing for example how he flipped the brush to incise with its butt end the rough curls spilling out of his cap.","224":"In July 1914, just prior to the outbreak of World War I, the famous German actress Tilla Durieux traveled to Paris with her husband, the art dealer Paul Cassirer, to pose for Renoir. The classicizing, pyramidal format of this composition lends a certain grandeur to the sitter, attired in the costume that the couturier Poiret designed for her role as Eliza Doolittle in George Bernard Shaw\u2019s Pygmalion in 1913. When Renoir painted this ambitious portrait, he was so crippled with arthritis that he had to sit in a wheelchair with his brush strapped to his hand. ","225":"Six-year-old George Drummond is shown on his pony, the object of admiring gazes from his foster brother and sister. George became a member of the family bank, married, had four children, and died at age 49. By contrast, by 1821, his father had taken up a life of gambling and dissipation, abandoned his wife and children, and was living with the wife of a naval officer.The preeminent painter of the Scottish enlightenment, Raeburn was knighted by King George IV and given the title King\u2019s Painter and Limner in Scotland.","226":"The sitter, a brilliant political figure who served under every French ruler from Louis XVI to Louis-Philippe, commissioned this portrait from Prud'hon in 1817. The artist had already painted two full-length portraits of Talleyrand for Napoleon for the Ch\u00e2teau de Compi\u00e8gne: one in 1806 (Ch\u00e2teau de Valen\u00e7ay) and another in 1807 (Mus\u00e9e Carnavalet, Paris). The pose here was based on the 1807 picture while the costume was updated.","227":"Cav\u00e9 held the high-ranking posts of inspector and director of the fine arts administration during the reign of King Louis-Philippe. Ingres painted this portrait soon after Cav\u00e9's marriage in 1844 to Marie-Elisabeth Blavot Boulanger. It was intended as a companion to the picture of Cav\u00e9's wife that Ingres had painted a decade earlier (43.85.3). After Ingres consulted Cav\u00e9 about the dimensions of his wife's likeness, he executed the portrait by transferring a drawing of the sitter (Mus\u00e9e Ingres, Montauban) onto the canvas.","228":"Although the panel shape and palette of paintings 09.181 and 09.181.2 are very similar, differences in the hair and beards suggest that the portrait of the man with the mole (09.181.2)  is about a generation earlier than the other. The man with the mole is turned from a three-quarters right position to direct his arresting gaze toward the viewer. His enormous eyes have highlights and are further emphasized by pink paint along the lids. Pink was also used to shade the long nose. His flesh is a warm peach color. For more on the technique used to create this portrait, see 09.181.1.Link to the Artist ProjectY.Z. Kami on Egyptian mummy portraits","229":"In 1850 Page traveled to Italy and remained there for a decade. There, he became infatuated with the Venetian Renaissance masters--particularly Titian--and attempted to emulate their technique. Page\u2019s layering of pigments in this diminutive rendering of a man and a child reflects his interest in Titian\u2019s method of achieving luminosity in his paintings. By loosely applying small strokes of watercolor Page created a sense of informality appropriate to the scale of the work, which has the intimacy of portraits rendered in miniature. The artist\u2019s difficulty in depicting the \ufb02esh tones is suggested by the amount of scraping that appears on the faces, but he attended carefully to the details of the upholstery and costumes, both of which contribute to the charm and appealing sentimentality of this closely observed domestic portrait.","230":"Madame Marsollier was married, beneath her station, to a Parisian textile merchant whose shop was in the rue Saint-Honor\u00e9. Her portrait, exhibited at the Salon in 1750, displays in full measure the luxury fabrics that were the source of his fortune. The lady and her child are en d\u00e9shabille, in revealing draperies that accentuate their pearly skin. It is not surprising that the wealthy couple would have commissioned a large portrait from Nattier, who was then the preeminent painter of the French royal family.","231":"Full-length portraits of less than royal sitters were exceptional in the Netherlands until Rubens and Van Dyck, and in Amsterdam Thomas de Keyser and Rembrandt, made them fashionable. This unassuming portrait of a woman in a quaintly underscaled landscape achieves a distinctive charm and intimacy.","232":"Best known as a portraitist, Loop was a popular choice among artists who were newly elected as associate Academicians to the National Academy of Design to satisfy the requirement that they provide portraits of themselves. The realist sculptor John Quincy Adams Ward (1830-1910) was elected an associate of the Academy in 1862 and a full Academician in 1863, later serving as president of the organization in 1873-74, the first sculptor to do so. This cabinet-sized likeness on panel is presumably a study for or reduced replica after Ward\u2019s presentation portrait on canvas (19 7\/8 x 15 7\/8 in.) by Loop in the National Academy\u2019s collection. Both depict the artist in a three-quarter bust-length pose against a monochromatic background. Ward has a full red beard and moustache and appears in contemporary dress\u2014white shirt, brown bow tie and vest, and a black coat. The Metropolitan\u2019s version descended in the family of Eliza Ward Thomas, Ward\u2019s eldest sister, and remains in its original frame.","233":"Moses Gill (1733-1800), a Boston hardware merchant (later governor of Massachusetts), probably commissioned this portrait of himself as a wedding gift for his wife, Sarah Prince.  In 1764, Gill went to Copley again for oil portraits of himself and Sarah (both Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design, Providence).","234":"Eakins began this portrait shortly after his marriage in January 1884 to his former student, Susan Hannah Macdowell (1851\u20131938), a talented painter and photographer. The setting is his studio at 1330 Chestnut Street in Philadelphia, where the couple\u2014and their dog, Harry\u2014lived from 1884 to 1886. A photogravure of the painting from 1886 reveals a more robust woman, suggesting that Eakins reworked the portrait, amplifying the effect of the skylight\u2019s illumination. The alterations may have reflected Eakins\u2019s anguish over his controversial dismissal from the school of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, partly for removing the loincloth from a male model in a co-ed class.","235":"This portrait miniature, superbly executed in enamel, is a lovely example of a type very popular amongst middle- and moneyed-classes of Europe and the United States in the mid-nineteenth century. The sitter\u2019s husband, English collector Alfred Morrison, was a champion of the artist, Lepec, and twenty years\u2019 later commissioned a second enamel portrait of his wife (who seems hardly to have aged), also in The Met\u2019s collection (2010.33). Morrison acquired an astonishingly large exhibition piece, an Italianate enameled vase and stand, also made by Lepec for display at the 1867 Paris Exposition Universelle, also in The Met\u2019s collection (2004.452).","236":"Joan of Arc, the medieval teenaged martyr from the French province of Lorraine, gained new status as a patriotic symbol when France ceded the territory to Germany after the Franco-Prussian War (1870\u201371). Bastien-Lepage, a native of Lorraine, depicts the moment when Saints Michael, Margaret, and Catherine appear to the peasant girl in her parents\u2019 garden, rousing her to fight the English invaders in the Hundred Years War. Critics at the Salon of 1880 praised Bastien-Lepage\u2019s use of pose and facial expression to convey Joan\u2019s spiritual awakening, but found the inclusion of the saints at odds with his naturalistic style.","237":"","238":"Margaret Izard (1768-1824) of Charleston married the planter and amateur architect Gabriel Manigault in 1785. This portrait relates to the oil by Gilbert Stuart in the Albright-Knox Gallery, Buffalo, New York.","239":"Largely forgotten today, De Lairesse was celebrated in his lifetime as a painter and advocate for an idealizing manner based on the study of classical antiquity. This work, likely destined to hang over the mantelpiece in a grand Amsterdam home, depicts the sun god consorting with the goddess of the dawn, a popular subject in French and Italian painting at the time. The attractively individualized young faces have led to speculation that they may be disguised portraits of a newly married couple.","240":"During his second sojourn in England (1532\u201343) Holbein made portraits for a new clientele, the German merchants of the Hanseatic League, whose guildhall was located in the London Steelyard. The sitter, whose ring displays the arms of the Wedighs of Cologne, is probably Hermann von Wedigh III, portrayed at age twenty-nine. The Latin quotation on the sheet of paper in the foreground, reading \"Truth breeds hatred,\" comes from the Roman comedy Andria by Terence, popular among Humanists. The inserted slip of paper could thus refer to the book\u2019s content and perhaps have served as the sitter\u2019s personal motto. ","241":"This painting is based on a print, part of a suite of fifteen etchings by Chass\u00e9riau illustrating Shakespeare\u2019s Othello, which was published in Paris in 1844. It depicts act 4, scene 3 of the play, a final moment of calm preceding Desdemona\u2019s murder by her husband, Othello. The lyre she holds was not described by Shakespeare; Chass\u00e9riau observed it in an 1836 production in which the role was performed by the celebrated singer Maria Malibran Garcia (1808\u20131836), called La Malibran.","242":"Owen was a contemporary and rival of Sir Thomas Lawrence. The Heathcote portrait employs an unusual conceit, showing the grandchildren of a wealthy baronet dressed as cottage children. The sheaves of wheat allude to the harvest. The painting, exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1806, is one of nearly a dozen portraits executed by the artist for members of Sir William's family.","243":"In 1872 Henry James described this picture as \"the perfect prose of portraiture\" . . . in van der Helst's \"unmitigated verity you detect no faintest throb of invention blossoming into style and straggling across the line which separates a fine likeness from a fine portrait.\" The American aesthete's backhanded praise passes over such considerations as the placement of the figure within the picture field and the sitter's expression, both of which contribute to an impression of quiet authority. ","244":"Angela D. King (1834-1917) was born in Brooklyn and became the wife of Thomas Hicks in 1855. Both she and Hicks were active in the city's artistic and literary circles. Mrs. Hicks was evidently both fascinating and popular. It is said that \"Angie\" inspired the poet and diplomat George H. Boker of Philadelphia to compose many sonnets to her over a period of thirty years. Her admirers also included the author and editor Parke Godwin. Hicks probably painted this portrait of his wife in 1884, the year it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design in New York.","245":"Mrs. Chesebrough, born Margaret Sylvester, was the wife of a wealthy and prominent merchant in Newport, Rhode Island. The couple later lived in Stonington, Connecticut.  Blackburn seems to have been trained in England before coming to work on this side of the Atlantic. He apparently spent a couple of years as a portraitist in Bermuda before establishing himself in New England. This likeness, dated 1754, is one of his first American works. A decade later he was back in England, presumably supplanted in American colonial painting by the young and rapidly developing Copley, who was becoming a major figure. The Museum's portrait shows Blackburn's skill in rendering drapery and details of costume, and in making his sitters look fashionable and elegant.","246":"Before serving as seventh president of the United States (1829-37), Andrew Jackson (1767-1845) was a member of the House of Representatives, a  United States senator, a major general in the army, and the first  governor of Florida. The occasion for this formal, military portrait was his triumphal visit to New York in 1819, during which he was celebrated as the hero of the War of 1812 for his decisive victory over the British at New Orleans. The Corporation of the City of New York selected Jarvis's competitor John Vanderlyn to paint the official portrait for City Hall, but Jackson himself gave a commission to Jarvis, who soon painted at least seven more portraits for Jackson's friends and political allies, including Samuel Swartwout who vouched for the accuracy of the likeness. In April 1819, he wrote:  \"I have just been to see Jarvis's portrait of you.  It is imimitable.\"","247":"This imposing portrait is one of four that Goya painted of members of Count Altamira's family. (Another is the Museum's portrait of Don Manuel Osorio Manrique de Zu\u00f1iga [49.7.41].) The patronage of this powerful family greatly advanced the artist's career; shortly after this work was completed, he was appointed court painter to Charles IV, king of Spain. Goya's brilliant treatment of the countess' gown, with its shimmering embroidered silk, attests to his mastery of technique, while the distant, introspective expressions of the sitters reveal his ability to endow even the most formal of portraits with a penetrating psychological immediacy.","248":"Another of Steen\u2019s self-deprecating depictions of his own unruly household, this painting centers on the inviting figure of his wife, who looks out at the viewer with an empty wineglass in her hand. Steen, his face flushed with drink and a comic hat on his head, sits at the far left; next to him, with a sausage in his cap, is Hans Worst, the same theatrical figure depicted by Hals in a nearby work. To this day in the Netherlands, \"a household by Jan Steen\" remains proverbial for disorder and domestic chaos.","249":"Gerard ter Borch was one of the most compelling Dutch artists of the seventeenth century, recognized then as now for his handsome portraits and refined genre subjects. These splendid pendant portraits of Jan van Duren and his wife, Margaretha van Haexbergen (1975.1.141 and 1975.1.142), rank among the most important works by the artist in any American collection. Jan van Duren, a member of the elite ruling class of Deventer, poses in the rich attire of a prosperous regent, while his stately wife is no less suitably clad. Ter Borch presents his patrons in a setting devoid of detail: a simple velvet covered table and fringed velvet chair accompany the sitters. The restrained setting contrasts with and enhances Ter Borch's precisely painted subjects, dignified and ennobled by his sensitive brush.","250":"This bust-length portrait depicts the seventy-six-year-old mother of Eakins\u2019s artist-friend Robert Arthur. As a representation of an elderly model absorbed in an old-fashioned task, the work recalls Eakins\u2019s The Writing Master, a portrait of his father, hanging nearby. Here, as in the earlier painting, the artist used strong contrasts of light and dark to define forms and highlight the hands and face, suggesting both manual dexterity and the wisdom of age. Its austere palette and quiet eloquence also reveal Eakins\u2019s study of works by the seventeenth-century masters Rembrandt, Ribera, and Vel\u00e1zquez.","251":"This portrait of an unidentified man, depicted in an interior with a landscape seen through the open window at the left, ultimately derives from a composition developed by early Netherlandish masters, namely Dieric Bouts in his 1462 Portrait of a Man (National Gallery, London). Dated 1491, it advances the formula by capturing the self-assured demeanor of the sitter, who directly addresses the viewer with a sidelong glance. The painting has been assigned to various regional German schools, but its closest analogy is found in the early portraits of D\u00fcrer, who was active in Nuremberg.","252":"This sitter joins his hands in prayer, contemplating what must have been a devotional image on an adjacent panel, now missing. The depiction of the features is very sensitive, particularly the nuanced rendering of the mouth, the age lines of the brow, and the white stubble visible along the contour of the left cheek. The portrait is stylistically similar to works by both Robert Campin and Rogier van der Weyden; it may have been painted by an artist in Campin's Tournai workshop while Rogier was an influential assistant there.","253":"Born Deborah Lyde, Mrs. Francis Brinley (1698\u20131761) was the daughter of Edward and Catherine Lyde and the granddaughter of Judge Nathaniel  Byfield (see portrait by Smibert, 24.109.87). When she married Francis Brinley in 1718, she was a woman of wealth and social prominence. An entry in Smibert's notebook dated May 1729 identifies the infant as  the Brinley's son Francis (1729\u20131816). Mrs. Brinley holds a sprig of  orange blossoms, a gesture which may have been taken from an eighteenth-century print by Sir Peter Lely. The white orange blossom symbolizes both marriage and purity, while the fruit, a sign of fertility, emphasizes Mrs. Brinley's role as a mother.  Orange trees, although fashionable in Europe, were expensive rarities in the colonies. The presence of one here reinforces  the sitter's wealth. Smibert also painted a portrait of Mrs. Brinley's husband (62.79.1).","254":"This painting testifies to Murillo\u2019s ability to give his portraits a quality of psychological presence. Don Andr\u00e9s de Andrade y la Cal was pertiguero, or marshal of processions in the cathedral of Seville. Murillo adopted a formula used by both Titian and Vel\u00e1zquez in their portraits of Spanish royalty; his sitter is dressed in black and rests his right hand on his mastiff. The setting is a classical portico with the sitter\u2019s family coat of arms on the pier at left.","255":"This work was once thought to be a portrait of the painter Rosa Bonheur (1822\u20131899) as a child, but it seems to represent a boy. Corot's portraits were limited to friends and members of his family, but thus far the figure remains unidentified.","256":"While still in his teens, Hamilton (1757\u20131804) plunged into the revolutionary cause and was propelled headlong into the political arena. During the war, he distinguished himself by his intellect and military savvy. He later served in the Continental Congress, where he advocated a strong central government. He is perhaps best known for his activities as secretary of the treasury under George Washington and for his crucial role in establishing the first national bank, The Bank of New York. There was a great demand for portraits of Hamilton after his death by duel with Aaron Burr, and Trumbull produced several replicas, including this example, of a portrait he had made from life. Nearly a century later, the painting became the first early American work to enter the museum's collection.","257":"Jane Buller, the sitter in this elegant portrait, married William Lemon in 1771 and bore ten children. Lord Lemon commissioned George Romney to paint half-length portraits of himself and his wife in 1881, when Lady Lemon was forty-years old. She sat for the painting on six occasions in Romney\u2019s London studio. Posing the sitter in an armchair against a landscape background became a common convention in later Georgian British portraiture. Romney portrays his subject with a gentle touch.","258":"Philippe de Champaigne was one of the protagonists of French classicism. His art, inspired in part by his association with Jansenism (a severe Counter-Reformation movement suppressed by Louis XIV), has been described as combining \"a scrupulous perfectionism verging on coldness with an inner life of deep intensity.\" This picture was painted for the private chapel of Queen Anne of Austria (1601\u20131666), the widowed wife of Louis XIII. The chapel, a small oval room in the Palais Royal, Paris, was decorated by the most prominent French painters of the day.","259":"This painting is a version, with significant variations, of Ingres's self-portrait of 1804 (probably the canvas now in the Mus\u00e9e Cond\u00e9, Chantilly). Evidence suggests that it was made between 1850 and 1860 under Ingres's supervision by one of his pupils. In 1866, the master acquired the canvas at the estate sale of the man of letters and composer Gustave H\u00e9quet. The catalogue of the sale states that it was painted by H\u00e9quet's wife, although her first name is not given.","260":"As a young painter trained at the Academy in Paris in the post-Revolution years, Vanderlyn made a living both drawing and painting portraits of the American Community in France. In the pair of exquisitely wrought neoclassical portraits of the Strobel family--comparable to those of the young J.A.D. Ingres at this time--Vanderlyn deliberately contrasts the formality and angularity of Daniel Strobel with the more direct appeal and curvilinear forms of Anna and their toddler son (17.134.3). Anna Church Strobel was the daughter of the first American Minister to Portugal, and both the wife and sister of American Diplomats in France.","261":"","262":"In eighteenth-century Europe, Paris led the production of high-quality luxury goods. Parisian goldsmiths made a wide range of small, personal articles such as snuffboxes; \u00e9tuis to hold sealing wax, tweezers, or utensils for sewing; souvenirs, which contained thin ivory tablets for note taking; and shuttles for knotting lace. Gold snuffboxes and boxes decorated with portrait miniatures were prized and frequently given as royal gifts, often to ambassadors or members of the court in lieu of cash payments for their services. Coveted and admired, these boxes were produced from a variety of materials. The best were skillfully made of gold and embellished with diamonds, enameled decoration, lacquer, and other luxurious materials. By the middle of the century, the taking of snuff had become an entrenched social ritual, and the snuffbox, too, had become an important social prop. Snuffboxes were considered highly fashionable accessories, with some merchants advertising new boxes with each change of season. The popularity of snuffboxes extended to all levels of society, and for those who could not afford gold, boxes were produced in less expensive materials such as silver, tortoiseshell, porcelain, or domestically produced lacquer.","263":"The earliest American painter to train in Paris, John Vanderlyn learned well the lessons of French neo-classical painting and executed the finest portraits of his career just after his return home to New York. The commission to paint Margaret Bancker (1774-1867) and her toddler son probably came through Vanderlyn's patron, the statesman Aaron Burr, who was friendly with her husband, Colonel Marinus Willett (1740\u20131830; 17.87.1). Miss Bancker was Willett's third wife and the boy, named for his father, was born in 1801, the first of their five children. Vanderlyn's fascination with France can also be witnessed in his \"Panorama of the Palace and Gardens of Versailles,\" also in the Museum's collection (52.184).","264":"","265":"Her forehead crisscrossed with jewels, the sitter of this portrait displays a pink, or carnation, a symbol of love and marriage. The gilt picture frame visible in the background locates her in a luxurious interior, but her pensive expression elevates the portrait beyond a mere statement of status. If scholars are correct in identifying the sitter in the pendant portrait hanging next to this one as Pieter Haringh, then the woman who appears here must be his wife, Elisabeth Delft (ca. 1620\u20131679).","266":"The sitter, whose family were neighbors of the artist in Edinburgh, modelled for Raeburn at the painter's request. The portrait remained in the possession of the Raeburn family until 1877.","267":"One of the leading men in colonial Pennsylvania, Thomas Mifflin (1744\u20131800) later became governor of the state and a member of the legislature. During the Revolutionary War, he served with Trumbull as an aide-de-camp to General George Washington. Trumbull painted this miniature portrait at the same time as the nearly identical example in the collection of Yale University Art Gallery. Trumbull used the miniature portraits for depictions of Mifflin in two of his major history paintings, \"The Death of General Mercer at the Battle of Princeton\" and \"The Resignation of General Washington\" (both Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven, Conn.).","268":"After returning to the United States from London in 1789, Trumbull spent five years traveling up and down the Eastern Seaboard taking \u201cheads\u201d from life, mainly of statesmen and military officers. These exquisite works, which were preparatory to history paintings, stand out for their sensitive characterization and coloristic brilliance. The brushwork is fluid, with impastos and transparent glazes that produce contrasting textures. Trumbull\u2019s portrait of the Italian sculptor Giuseppe Ceracchi (1751\u20131801) was probably painted in Philadelphia in 1792. The ambitious Neoclassical sculptor had come to the United States to raise funds for a proposed monument to American liberty.","269":"Strobel's portrait of the Philadelphia merchant Jacob Gerard Koch (1761-1830) is posthumous, based on Rembrandt Peale's oil of about 1817 (Los Angeles County Museum of Art). Koch married Jane Griffith.","270":"","271":"In late March and early April 1801, the seventeen-year old son of Edward Satchwell Fraser and Jane Fraser of Reelig traveled to Edinburgh from his family home in Inverness-shire en route to London. It was the first of William Fraser\u2019s numerous visits to the studio of Sir Henry Raeburn, where this dashing portrait was painted. The finished portrait was dispatched to the family dining room in northern Scotland while its sitter was relocated to Delhi as a colonial servant of the East India Company. William fell under the Mughal spell, fathering numerous children from his harem of five or six Muslim and Hindu wives. He never returned to Scotland, for he was assassinated while commissioner of Delhi in 1835.","272":"This man\u2019s robe and tonsured hair indicate that he is a Benedictine, but whether this is a portrait of a contemporary monk or an image of a saint is not clear. The panel was cut from a larger image, and unlike some of the donor portraits on display, this sitter gazes downward, creating a more contemplative mood. His attenuated head, the sensitive modeling of his features, and the meditative expression are characteristic of Hugo van der Goes\u2019s late work.","273":"In 1798, Ralph Earl left his home in Connecticut, traveling throughout New England in search of portrait commissions. While in Vermont, he painted the most ambitious work of his career, a large group portrait of Chloe Burrall Smith (1757\u20131810) with her five children. Earl, who had trained in England, adopted a simplified style to suit the tastes of his rural patrons. Wearing a fashionable, yet modest silk gown, Mrs. Smith embraces her youngest daughter in a maternal gesture. The four older children are posed before a landscape, each holding an attribute. Of particular note is son Daniel (second to the left), who holds a \"Map of the World\"\u2014an emblem of the family\u2019s education and global ambitions.","274":"A celebrated masterpiece of Northern Renaissance Art, this painting was signed and dated 1449 by Petrus Christus, the leading painter in Bruges (Flanders) after the death of Jan van Eyck. The panel attests to Netherlandish artists\u2019 keen interest in pictorial illusionism and meticulous attention to detail, especially in the luminous jeweled, glass, and metallic objects, secular and ecclesiastic trade wares that are examples of the goldsmith's virtuosity. The main figure in this enigmatic painting was long identified as Saint Eligius (the patron saint of goldsmiths) due to the presence of a halo, which was recognized as a later addition and subsequently removed. The panel is likely a vocational painting, which portrays the profession of goldsmithing and perhaps a specific goldsmith. Technical analysis reveals the underdrawing of the goldsmith's face to be very carefully modeled\u2014more so than the faces of the couple\u2014indicating the possibility of a portrait. It has been suggested that he is Willem van Vleuten, a Bruges goldsmith who worked for Philip the Good, duke of Burgundy. In 1449, the date of this painting, the duke commissioned from van Vlueten a gift for Mary of Guelders on the occasion of her marriage to James II, King of Scots. That couple may well be depicted in this painting, portrayed buying a wedding ring that is being weighed on a scale. The girdle that extends over the ledge of the shop into the viewer\u2019s space is a further allusion to matrimony. The convex mirror, which links the pictorial space to the street outside, reflects two young men with a falcon (a symbol of pride and greed) and establishes a moral comparison between the imperfect world of the viewer and the world of virtue and balance depicted here.","275":"Duykinck was a member of one of the most important families of painters in New York State during the seventeenth century. As a teenager, he assisted his father Evert, who was a glazier in New York. By 1679, Gerrit referred to himself as a portraitist and not simply a craftsman. He did not sign or date the portraits he painted for private patrons in New Amsterdam and other Dutch towns in upstate New York.","276":"Of the five versions of Van Gogh\u2019s portrait of Augustine Roulin, wife of his friend the postmaster of Arles, the present canvas is the one the sitter chose for herself. Van Gogh remarked that \"she had a good eye and took the best.\" He began the portraits just before his breakdown in Arles, in December 1888, and completed them in early 1889, calling them \"La Berceuse,\" meaning \"lullaby, or woman who rocks the cradle,\" indicated by the rope held in the sitter\u2019s hand, which is attached to the unseen cradle.","277":"Mary Sylvester (1725\u20131794) was born at Southold, Long Island. She  was the daughter of Brinley and Mary Sylvester and the sister of  Margaret, later Mrs. David Chesebrough (see 16.68.3). Her portrait was  most likely painted in 1754, the year in which Blackburn painted the  portrait of her sister and of Abigail Chesebrough (Stonington Historical Society, Connecticut). In accordance with her unmarried  status, Blackburn depicted Mary Sylvester as a shepherdess, the lamb at her side a symbol of purity and innocence. Although an exact source  has not yet been identified, it has been assumed that Blackburn  derived this allegorical representation from a British mezzotint. In 1756 Mary Sylvester was married in Newport to Thomas Dering, a Boston  merchant. The exceptionally fine carved, painted and gilded frame is  original to the portrait.","278":"Daniel Webster (1782-1852), a celebrated orator, was a United States senator from Massachusetts and United States secretary of state. George Harrison Hite (q.v.) also painted his portrait.","279":"Abigail Willing Peters (1777-1841) was the daughter of the prominent Philadelphian Thomas Willing. This miniature relates to the 1797 oil portrait of her by Gilbert Stuart (Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, Philadelphia).","280":"","281":"Born in Massachusetts, Hathaway worked as an itinerant portrait painter before pursuing a career in medicine. \"Lady with Her Pets\" is his earliest known work and depicts Molly Wales Fobes of Raynham, Massachusetts. Fashionably dressed, Molly sits in a Chippendale-style chair surrounded by a fantastical array of \u201cpets,\u201d which were likely included as emblems of her beauty, loyalty, and affection. They may also reference her family\u2019s interest in natural history, as her father was a professor of Natural and Experimental Philosophy. The flowers decorating her fan and bodice, combined with her French-inspired hairstyle, identify Molly as a refined and worldly woman.","282":"Samuel Mifflin (1724\u20131781), an affluent Philadelphia businessman, commissioned this portrait and its pendant (22.153.2) in 1777. An ardent patriot, he commanded three artillery battalions and served on Pennsylvania\u2019s Council of Safety during the Revolutionary War. He also contributed a large sum to the fund established to equip George Washington\u2019s army. This work shows the strong influence of John Singleton Copley. Like Copley, Peale conveyed an impression of importance by means of a sumptuous setting and a firm and frank presentation of the sitter\u2019s portly person. The glimpse of sea and ship through the window alludes to Mifflin\u2019s mercantile success.","283":"This wedding group is one of the artist's first essays in the fashionable genre of the conversation piece. Beckingham, a London lawyer, and his bride are flanked by members of their families. The marriage took place at St. Benet's but the setting is based on the church of St. Martin-in-the-Fields in Trafalgar Square. Although Hogarth was sought after for his ability to capture a likeness, the solemn event depicted here seems to have had limited appeal to him by comparison with his famous satirical subjects.","284":"Jonathan Trumbull (1740-1809) was a United States senator and later governor of Connecticut.  He was the brother of the portrait and history painter John Trumbull (1756-1843).","285":"","286":"For the pendant to his portrait of Samuel Cutts (1979.196.1), Blackburn demonstrated his expertise as a drapery painter. The lace-trimmed gown of silk damask was not Mrs. Cutts\u2019s own but was copied from a British print of the latest fashion.","287":"The subject of this portrait is the nephew of Gericault\u2019s friend the painter Pierre-Joseph Dedreux-Dorcy. This canvas is one of a small group of drawings and paintings (in various collections) that depict the eight- or nine-year-old Alfred and his younger sister, Elisabeth, with remarkable self-possession and grace for their age. Alfred became a painter and, like Gericault, was enamored of horses. Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix, who had studied with Gericault, later owned this painting. ","288":"Copley presumably painted this miniature along with a nearly identical pastel portrait (1769, Winterthur Museum, Delaware), for his wife, Suzannah Clarke, as a wedding gift.","289":"This painting of a seated woman playing a kithara is from Room H, either a dining room (triclinium) or a room for social gatherings (oecus), in the villa at Boscoreale. Each of the paintings that originally adorned this room derives from the Greek tradition of megalographia, or large-scale painting, about which so much was written in antiquity; Apollinaris of Sidonius, Petronius in the Satyricon, and Vitruvius all shed light on the use of megalographia in Roman villas.In this fresco, the kithara player is depicted as a plump young woman clothed in a purple chiton and white himation. She is adorned with a bracelet, earrings, and headband with a central medallion, all of gold. A small figure of Atlas supports the arm of her elaborately carved chair that originally was lacquered a deep lustrous red. The instrument she plays is not a simple lyre, but a gilded kithara, a large concert instrument played by Apollo and professional musicians. Behind the seated woman stands a small girl wearing a sleeveless purple chiton. She, too, is adorned with a gold headband, bracelet, and loop earrings. Like portrait figures, the woman and the girl gaze directly at the spectator.Most recently it has been suggested that the pair may represent a Macedonian queen, or princess, and her daughter or younger sister. The gilded kithara and richly adorned, thronelike chair, as well as the carefully rendered gold jewelry and headbands, give the impression of royal personage. Whatever the exact subject, this painting and others in the villa were admired as excellent copies of Hellenistic art that emphasized the erudition and worldliness of the villa's owner.The Villa of P. Fannius Synistor at Boscoreale: A Virtual Tour","290":"","291":"","292":"The sitter (1818\/19-1841) was the son of Daniel Parkman (1794-1841) and Harriet Tilden (1797-1819). A later miniature portrait of him was painted by an unidentified artist.","293":"Dressed in his professorial robes and three-cornered hat, the legal scholar Bartolomeo Bonghi is shown holding a book on Roman civil law dedicated to him by its author in 1553. Through the open window is a tower that was one of the city of Bergamo\u2019s most identifiable landmarks. Moroni was admired throughout northern Italy for his ability to capture his sitters \"from life,\" or \"from nature,\" in the words of the Venetian artist Titian. Works such as this were doubtless studied by the young Caravaggio.","294":"Van Dyck depicts the Duke of Richmond and Lennox\u2014an intimate friend of King Charles I\u2014as a paragon of aristocratic self-possession and nonchalance. With a blonde lovelock spilling over his lace collar, the duke wears the insignia of the Order of the Garter, England\u2019s highest order of chivalry; the portrait may commemorate his investiture in November 1633. The greyhound resting its muzzle on the duke\u2019s hip alludes to the virtue of loyalty as well as the noble pastime of the hunt.","295":"Moretto\u2019s portrait asserts an active engagement with the viewer through the parapet decorated with a carpet and hourglass (an emblem of the passage of time and thus of mortality) as well as through the sitter\u2019s pose and glance. Moretto knew the portraits of Titian, but also those of another Venetian artist, Lorenzo Lotto, whose work was directly inspired by the example of D\u00fcrer. The suggestion of a vibrant, living presence is a unifying goal of sixteenth-century portraiture north and south of the Alps. Brescia, situated in the foothills of the Alps, was a locus of this enriching dialogue.","296":"This portrait is generally considered to be by Rembrandt, and is somewhat less uniformly thought to date from the 1650s. Both questions are made more difficult by the condition of the picture: the hands, the body, and the hat are badly abraded. The face is fairly well preserved.","297":"Vanderlyn, a New York native, executed this masterful self-portrait in Paris, where he had lived for four years; he was the first American-born painter to study in France. The work demonstrates the influence of Vanderlyn\u2019s teacher, Fran\u00e7ois-Andr\u00e9 Vincent, as well as that of the Neoclassical master Jacques-Louis David, who lauded the canvas at the Salon of 1800. The artist presented the portrait to his friend and patron, the American politician Aaron Burr. Vanderlyn\u2019s fascination with France would later result in the spectacular \"Panoramic View of the Palace and Gardens of Versailles\" (1818\u201319; 52.184), also on view in the American Wing (gallery 735).","298":"This portrait is among the first to depict a professional activity. Weighing gold coins while dressed in expensive fur, the sitter may have been one of the many merchants in Bruges who handled commodities, a money changer, or a banker, like Tommaso Portinari (14.40.626). In contrast to Memling\u2019s portrait, the source of this sitter\u2019s wealth is part of the subject, and the man is defined by his profession, not his piety. Isenbrant occupied a prominent position in Bruges, and ran a busy shop that produced works for both the local market and the export trade.","299":"This painting depicts the eminent monk Cheongheodang Hyujeong \uccad\ud5c8\ub2f9\ud734\uc815 (1520\u20131604), better known by his posthumous title, Seosan Daesa \uc11c\uc0b0\ub300\uc0ac, or Great Master Seosan. In addition to his role as a leader of Seon Buddhism (Chan in Chinese; Zen in Japanese), Seosan Daesa was also renowned for helping lead an army of Buddhist monks against invading Japanese forces to recover the capital (present-day Seoul) in the late sixteenth century. In a period when Buddhism was officially suppressed by the government in favor of Neo-Confucianism as ruling ideology, the religion continued to develop and, at times, to prosper. Seon Buddhism, which emphasized meditation, was among the sects that flourished.Idealized portraits of revered monks, especially patriarchs or founders of doctrinal schools, were enshrined in Buddhist temples. As is typical of such portraits from the Joseon period, the monk sits on a wood chair in three-quarter view and fills nearly the entire painting, which is devoid of a background setting. Seosan Daesa holds a large fly-whisk; his shoes are neatly arranged on a footstool. The careful delineation of facial features gives the subject a lifelike appearance. The inscription at the bottom center of the scroll provides the names of the donors who commissioned this portrait and of members of the monastery.","300":"This portrait most likely depicts the Amsterdam auctioneer Pieter Haringh (1609\u20131685), who once handled the sale of a famous portrait by the Italian Renaissance master Raphael that served Rembrandt as a source of inspiration. The sitter may have used the magnifying glass in his hand to evaluate paintings and other luxury goods circulating on the busy Amsterdam art market. Like his wife in the pendant portrait also on view here, the sitter wears a form of fancy dress that has little to do with Dutch clothing worn at the time.","301":"Unlike many of his ambitious contemporaries, Rembrandt never traveled to Italy. Nonetheless, Italian art had a profound effect on him; in this depiction of the Roman goddess of spring, he responded to the sixteenth-century Venetian master Titian in particular. Still, the somber coloration and rough paint handling make this work unmistakably Rembrandt\u2019s own, and the goddess may be based in part on a portrait of the artist\u2019s deceased wife, Saskia, who had been the muse and inspiration for many of his paintings.","302":"This damaged but evocative portrait has been identified as the widow of Credi's brother, who was a goldsmith. This would explain why she is dressed in black and holds a ring. The juniper bush (ginepro) behind her could refer to her name, Ginevra di Giovanni di Niccol\u00f2. The picture was inspired by Leonardo's portrait of Ginevra de' Benci in the National Gallery of Art, Washington.","303":"These posthumous portraits of the Saxon electors Friedrich III, the Wise, and Johann I, the Constant belong to a series of sixty such portrait pairs, ordered by Johann I\u2019s son and successor, Johann Friedrich I, the Magnanimous, when he became elector in 1532. He intended the portraits of his father and uncle to serve as instruments of propaganda. The accompanying laudatory poems emphasize the passage of Saxon electoral preeminence from Friedrich to Johann, thereby implying the legitimacy of Johann Friedrich\u2019s own electorate. Completed in 1533, the extensive series demonstrates the speed and efficiency of which the Cranach workshop was capable.","304":"Brown\u2019s grand-manner portrait of General George Eliott (1717\u20131790) is a great spectacle that captured both the painter and his subject at the pinnacle of their respective careers. Descended from America\u2019s earliest settlers, Brown grew up in Boston and trained in London under Benjamin West. General Eliott commanded the British garrison against the allied Spanish and French forces at Gibraltar (1779\u201383). The pyrotechnic portrait shows Eliott during a battle in September 1782, when the British deployed the newly devised technique of heated shot, annihilating the enemy fleet. (Eliott is also portrayed in John Trumbull\u2019s painting of the scene; 1976.332.)","305":"The ingenious British architect John Haviland (1792 - 1852) sat for his contemporary John Neagle, while at work on the building that would make him famous. Haviland's Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia (1823-29), one of the largest architectural projects yet undertaken in the United States, was hailed as revolutionary and epochal. In this portrait, Haviland appears to be checking with calipers his innovative scheme of cells radiating from a central core; his plan would later influence prison design internationally. The watercolor rendering at right shows the neo-Gothic facade of the prison, while the book--a volume of James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's \"The Antiquities of Athens\" (1762-1816)--betrays his eclectic stylistic interests. Haviland later designed the Hall of Justice in New York (fondly called \"The Tombs\") and was a founder of the American Institute of Architects.","306":"In style and execution this portrait of a dignified older gentleman is consistent with Rembrandt's work of about 1645\u201350. The picture's apparent quality has been diminished by abrasion in the face; the jawline is retouched and the hand reconstructed. The eyes, mouth, and textures of skin and hair remain typical of Rembrandt.","307":"This man's intent, direct gaze and parted lips make him seem restive. The remarkably free brushwork builds up forms without reliance on clean contours. The portrait has striking atmospheric qualities, such as the strands of seeminly damp hair that cling to the man's brow.The gilding of the wreath and background was added after the panel had been inserted into the mummy wrapping.For more on the technique used to create this portrait, see 09.181.1.","308":"This painting is an early copy of a portrait by Raphael of Giuliano de Medici, Pope Leo X's younger brother.  Giuliano sat for his portrait so that it could be sent to Philiberte of Savoy, the aunt of Francis I of France, to whom he had become engaged. As the couple had not yet met the portrait gave her an idea of his appearance. The match was a political one. Pope Leo was hoping to cement the alliance between the French and the papacy. Portraits were often included in the diplomatic arrangements of such dynastic marriages.","309":"The sitter (1755-1828) was a celebrated American portrait painter, best known today for his images of George Washington. Another version of this miniature is in the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington, D.C.","310":"In this bold self-portrait, a miniature painter depicts himself with the tools of his trade, including paint brushes and an oval ivory palette with watercolor pigments (similar to those on display nearby). Seated in a colonial side chair and fashionably dressed in an embroidered blue waistcoat, he pauses from painting a miniature portrait of a young woman to meet the viewer\u2019s gaze. Although the artist\u2019s identity remains unknown, he is believed to have been biracial and likely worked in or around New Orleans, Louisiana, where this self-portrait was discovered.","311":"Hugo van der Goes produced some of the most celebrated altarpieces of the Northern Renaissance. The heightened realism of this portrait, especially the beard stubble, is a hallmark of his work. By setting the man\u2019s head against a dark interior, next to a bright window, the accentuated contrast of light and shadow enhances the modeling of the facial features. The portrait was later cut into an oval shape from a rectangular panel, which probably originally formed part of a devotional triptych. The sitter, with his hands joined in eternal prayer, directs his gaze toward the missing religious image.","312":"Van Uffel was a wealthy Flemish merchant who lived in Venice, where Van Dyck probably painted this portrait early in his Italian period (1621\u201327). In another portrait (Herzog Anton Ulrich-Museum, Brauschweig), Van Dyck shows the same sitter authoritatively posed before a view of ships sailing off a Mediterranean coast. Ours, by contrast, shows Van Uffel as a learned gentleman, with signs of his varied interests: dividers, a recorder, the bow of a viola da gamba, an antique head, a drawing, and a celestial globe.","313":"Francis Brinley (1690\u20131765) was born in England but moved to Newport, Rhode Island in 1710 at the request of his grandfather. He eventually settled in Boston, where he married Deborah Lyde, granddaughter of Nathaniel Byfield (24.109.87). In 1719, he inherited  a substantial tract of land in Roxbury upon which he built the elaborate Datchet House residence. Smibert painted this portrait in Boston in May of 1729. The background, an early instance of landscape in American painting, represents a view of Boston from Brinley's  country home. Smibert also painted a portrait of Brinley's wife (62.79.2).","314":"This painting is from a series of ten magnificent canvases painted to decorate the main room of Ca\u2019 Dolfin, Venice. The subject of this triumphal procession is identified by the Latin inscription at the top of the painting, from the Roman historian Lucius Anneus Florus: \"The people of Rome behold Jugurtha laden with chains\". The African king Jugurtha is shown before his captor, the Roman general Gaius Marius. The procession was held on January 1, 104 B.C. The crowds carry booty, including a bust of the mother goddess Cybele. The thirty-year-old Tiepolo included his self-portrait among the figures on the left.","315":"Edward Blake Parkman (1818\/1819-1841) was the son of Daniel Parkman (1794-1841) and Harriet Tilden (1797-1819). An earlier portrait of him was painted by Sarah Goodridge (q.v.; 1990.204.3).","316":"Johnson, the son of an enslaved woman and a white man, was the first known African American artist in the United States to earn his living as a professional portrait painter. He worked in Baltimore, Maryland, from about 1789 to 1825, painting likenesses of sea captains, shopkeepers, and merchants and their families. In this portrait of Edward Pennington Rutter (ca. 1798\u20131827) and Sarah Ann Rutter (1802\u20131843), children of Captain Joshua and Mary Pennington Rutter of Baltimore, Johnson demonstrated his affinity for bright, strong colors and precise detail, as seen in the red bird at the left and the strawberries held by the children. There is an air of stillness, of suspended action, in Johnson\u2019s portraits that is emphasized here by the intensity of the children\u2019s gazes.","317":"Blackburn, a British immigrant, worked in the Boston area for only nine years before returning to England. The companion portraits of Samuel Cutts (1726\u20131801), a prosperous merchant in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, and Anna Holyoke (1735\u20131812; 1979.196.2) of Boston, executed around the time of their marriage, seem to have been among the last works he painted in this country. Cutts, his proudly substantial figure dominating the picture, turns to face the spectator. The harbor view through the window refers to his shipping business.","318":"This tiny manuscript illumination, a sympathetic portrait of Christ, belongs to the tradition of religious images known as acheiropoita, images believed to have been created miraculously. It is one of a group of representations of the head of Christ, called the Holy Face, that have their roots in Byzantine legend and in the legend of Saint Veronica. The story of Veronica became enormously popular in Europe in the thirteenth century, and medieval pilgrims traveled to Saint Peter's in Rome to see what they believed to be the actual veil of St. Veronica (known as the sudarium), impressed with the image of Christ's face.Holy Face miniatures were particularly popular in Books of Hours made in Bruges toward the end of the fifteenth century and into the beginning of the sixteenth. Although there are no signed miniatures by Gerard David, nor indeed any panel paintings today that bear his signature, there is a strong possibility that this miniature was one of several illuminations by David excised from a Book of Hours, dated 1486 and now in the collection of the Escorial, Spain. The volume is missing a number of miniatures that were cut out at an unknown date, among them an image of the Holy Face that accompanies the prayer or hymn \"Salva sancta facies\" in the front of the book. The dimensions, proportions, and even the traces of the arched top of the Lehman illumination match the corresponding features of the few miniatures in the Escorial volume that have been attributed to David.","319":"In 1517 Holbein decorated the house of the Lucerne magistrate Jacob von Hertenstein. Concurrently, he made this portrait of the magistrate's eldest son, Benedikt, who engages the viewer both with his direct glance and the inscription, which reads as if he is speaking: \"When I looked like this I was twenty-two years old.\" Directly following these words is the declaration that \"H.H.\" painted the work. The artist\u2019s use of paper mounted on wood is unusual but not unique. He initiated the portrait as a drawing on paper and then continued working up in oil colors to its completion. ","320":"A devoted and influential member of many of the leading learned organizations of his day, Gulian Verplanck (1786-1870) was a member of one of New York's most prominent families, descended from the earliest settlers of New Amsterdam.  Jarvis's choice of a horizontal format for his portrait of Verplanck was highly unusual and inspired: it captures the liberal spirit of this young man of wealth, leisure, and intelligence, who allowed the painter to experiment with conventional portrait composition in order to provide greater context for the likeness.","321":"","322":"In this large, allegorical family portrait, the Dinteville brothers act out a scene from Exodus 7:9. Pleading with Pharaoh to free the Israelites, Aaron (Fran\u00e7ois II de Dinteville) transforms his rod into a serpent, proving that God is with him. Jean de Dinteville is depicted as Moses, while Gaucher and Guillaume stand behind them. The brothers were important members of the court of Francis I, who is represented as Pharaoh. Painted during a critical moment in their relationship with the French king, this extraordinary portrait hung in the family ch\u00e2teau of Polisy with an even more exceptional depiction of Jean de Dinteville: Holbein\u2019s Ambassadors (National Gallery, London).","323":"","324":"William Duguid, a Scottish immigrant textile importer based in Boston, is the subject of this engaging portrait. In 1773 he sat for Prince Demah, a painter of African descent, who was the \"property\" of merchant Henry Barnes. Impressed with his talent, Barnes took Demah to London in 1771, where he studied briefly with Robert Edge Pine. Demah\u2019s story is extraordinary\u2014he is the only enslaved artist working in colonial America whose paintings are known to have survived. To date, three portraits by him have been identified. When his Loyalist owners fled to England in 1775, the artist remained in Boston, identifying himself as \"Prince Demah, limner\" and a \"free Negro.\" He enlisted in the Massachusetts militia in 1777 to fight against the British, but died of an unknown illness the following year.","325":"Gerard de Lairesse (1641\u20131711) was, in his day, a well-known painter, etcher, and art theorist. He suffered from congenital syphilis, which caused him to go blind about 1690; he subsequently focused his energies on art theory. By the time this portrait was painted, in 1665, the ravaging effects of the disease were visible in his swollen features and bulbous nose. Recording his unfortunate appearance with an uncompromising directness, Rembrandt invested his subject with an air of quiet dignity. Although the sitter's theories on the ideal in painting were antithetical to Rembrandt's style, which Lairesse disparagingly likened to \"liquid mud on the canvas,\" the portrayal is a sympathetic one.","326":"This unidentified sitter wears the black habit of a Benedictine monk, and probably formed the left wing of a diptych or triptych. The portrait combines a mix of artistic influences and can be compared to both Flemish and French portraits. The attention to details, like the stubble of his beard, relates to Flemish portraits, while the lighting is more dramatic and emphasizes the sculptural quality of the head and hands. A similar blue background can be seen in Clouet\u2019s later portrait of Guillaume Bud\u00e9 (46.68).","327":"The sitter (1777-1846) was born in Salem, Massachusetts, and by the time of this portrait was city solicitor for Boston.","328":"This portrait of the artist's mother was made before William Russell Birch arrived in America.","329":"The arch shape of this painting suggests it was intended for a niche in an architectural setting, probably a palace or pavilion, where it would have been displayed as part of a larger decorative program along with other portraits of the ruler, princes, and other court members. Typical of Qajar lifesize oil portraits from the first quarter of the nineteenth century, it shows the prince standing in front of a window with a pierced wooden balustrade. The background is undecorated in order to accentuate the opulence of the his costume and accoutrements. Based on the treatment of the textiles, jeweled elements, palette, and articulation of the facial features, the portrait can be related to two signed paintings of princes by the artist Muhammad Hasan, one of the foremost portrait artists during the reign of Fath \u02bdAli Shah Qajar (reigned 1797\u20131834). Here, the prince wears a jewel-studded robe and red sash with paisley designs, carries a sword with a bejeweled sheath, and dons a black astrakhan hat with a jeweled aigrette. Touching the saber sheath with one hand, he holds a falcon with the other. Falconry, the privileged sport of royalty and nobility in Iran for centuries, was enjoyed by numerous Qajar princes.","330":"By 1783 Earl was a member of the entourage of American artists in the London studio of Benjamin West, where he absorbed the lessons of the British portrait tradition. He persisted, however, in painting forceful characterizations of his subjects and capturing the materiality of objects; both proclivities reveal the continuing influence of John Singleton Copley\u2019s colonial portraits. Here, Earl conveyed maternal affection along with precise details of costume and furnishings in illusionistic passages such as the reflection of a leg of the inkstand on the tabletop.","331":"Soon after his return from London, where he had studied under Benjamin West, Pratt painted the portraits of Reynold Keen (1738\u2013 1800; 2008.244), a successful Philadelphia merchant, and his wife, Christiana Stille (1744\u20131777), a Philadelphia heiress. Their affable faces and luxurious surroundings describe their well-being, early in their married life.","332":"Joseph Wright of Derby was the first major British painter to work almost entirely outside London. Most of his patrons were merchants or industrialists from the Midlands or members of the local gentry. This portrait of an unknown lady was probably painted about 1770, the high point of Wright's early career as a portraitist, and is a fine example of the direct, descriptive style he employed\u2014far removed from the artificial conventions favored in London society.","333":"","334":"Van Dyck was in Palermo, Sicily, when a plague broke out and the city was quarantined. On July 15, 1624, the remains of Saint Rosalie\u2014the city\u2019s patroness, who died about 1160\u2014were opportunely discovered on Mount Pellegrino, which is visible here above the harbor of Palermo. Images of Saint Rosalie were in great demand; this one was painted by Van Dyck on top of a striking self-portrait that he had sketched on the canvas. The artist employed a design he had used earlier for paintings of the Assumption of the Virgin.","335":"In this scene, representing Paradise, Christ and God the Father are above, surrounded by the symbols of the Evangelists and flanked by the Virgin and Saint John the Baptist. The foreground figures represent (left) the Doctors of the Church, (center) Saint George, and (right) Saint Christopher. It is likely that the man looking out from bottom left may be a portrait of the original (unidentified) patron. Saraceni left Venice for Rome in 1598, and this picture, which is based on an altarpiece by Francesco Bassano in the church of the Ges\u00f9, was painted about this time.","336":"At the time he sat for this portrait, Calhoun, one of the preeminent American statesmen of the nineteenth century, was serving as United States Senator from South Carolina. Dubourjal does not idealize his portrait, but emphasizes the striking features of Calhoun\u2019s visage: his piercing, deep-set eyes, high brow, thin lips, and hollow cheeks. The delicate cross-hatching on the face and in the background contrasts with the full, sinuous lines in the hair. Color is used sparingly, only in the face, and there are touches of white gouache on the eyes, collar, and shirt. The drawing may have been acquired by author and poet Anne Charlotte Lynch shortly after its completion; it was exhibited at the National Academy of Design, New York, in 1847, together with a miniature portrait of her by Dubourjal (95.2.3).","337":"Little is known about this plucky woman wearing a dramatic, wide-shouldered dress. The inscription at upper right dedicates the portrait to the Nys family, and the sitter has historically been identified as Mademoiselle Nys. She may be one of the many acquaintances who posed for Lautrec; at around the time he made this work, friends also tried to help the artist secure important portrait commissions, but society women soon fled in dismay from their sittings, after suffering insult.","338":"The background of this portrait was originally gilded, emphasizing the divine status of the deceased young woman. She looks at the viewer with large serious eyes, accentuated by long lashes. A mass of loose curls covers her head, and some strands fall along the back of her neck on the left side. Framed by the black hair, deeply shadowed neck, and dark red tunic, her brightly lit face stands out in appealing youthfulness, an impression that is heightened by the gold wreath and sparkling jewelry.For more on the technique used to create this portrait, see 09.181.1.Link to the Artist ProjectY.Z. Kami on Egyptian mummy portraits","339":"Guiji (632\u2013682), a Chinese Buddhist monk of the Tang dynasty, transmitted the Hoss\u014d sect teachings to Japan (where he is known as Jion Daishi) and translated Buddhist scripture. He was the most accomplished of the disciples of Xuanzang (602\u2013664), whose portrait is displayed in this exhibition. Portraits of venerated monks were hung in temples and connected followers to a heritage of rigorous thought and exemplary deeds. Religious genealogy reinforced the legitimacy of the institutions. The same ideology informed the arts in Japan. This scroll is an adaptation of a seated portrait used in the Jion-e memorial rites at Yakushiji temple in Nara. The archaic line style, derived from Tang dynasty conventions, enhances the intensity of the figure. The combination of monumentality and humanity is a classic expression of religious portraiture, in which conveying character is more important than achieving a physical likeness.","340":"","341":"This portrait is a pendant to the Portrait of a Man (29.100.3). If the man is Cornelis van Beresteyn, then the woman must be his second wife, Corvina van Hofdyck (1602\u20131667). Her pose, including the precise positions of the hands (one holding an ostrich fan), repeats that of her mother-in-law as depicted by Jacob Willemsz. Delff in 1592. Rembrandt's pair portraits appear to have conformed in design to a dynastic ensemble of portraits that originally hung in the Van Beresteyn family home in Delft.","342":"The sitters are the four sons of the hide and leather merchant Shepherd Knapp (1795\u20131875) and his wife, Catherine Louisa Kumbel (1793\u20131872). They are, from left to right, Gideon Lee (1821\u20131875), Shepherd Fordyce (1832\u20131886), William Kumbel (1827\u20131877), and Peter Kumbel (1825\u20131871). Shepherd Fordyce Knapp appears to be no older than two, which would date the work to 1833 or 1834. All of the children would marry and Gideon Lee Knapp would later become the owner and manager of the Green Point Ferry. The portrait type, among the most complex and successful painted by Waldo and Jewett, is one informed by eighteenth-century English portraiture. Waldo studied in London between 1806 and 1809 and his exposure to portraits by Benjamin West, in whose studio he was an assistant, is evident.","343":"Lehmann executed several portraits, both painted and drawn, of his first cousin Faustine L\u00e9o. This portrait clearly emulates the example of his master, Ingres, notably in its smooth, polished surface and the crisply delineated contours of the figure. Yet its intensely saturated palette and intimate mood set Lehmann's work apart from that of Ingres. The portrait bears its original frame.","344":"Bradley may have emigrated from Ireland in 1826. By 1836 he had established himself as a portraitist in New York, where he attracted sitters eager for his marked attention to likeness and detail. For this portrait of two-year-old Emma Homan (1842\u20131908), Bradley posed her standing next to a potted rosebush and playing with her cat, which scales the plant and extends a paw to bat Emma\u2019s finger.","345":"In this closely observed and sympathetic portrayal of an old man, special attention is given to how light models the subject\u2019s wrinkled, time-worn face. This objective realism is characteristic of the paintings of Hugo van der Goes, especially those of the early 1470s. However, Hugo\u2019s works do not include independent portraits, and additionally, the technique of oil on paper is relatively rare. The extremely tight cropping of the image, uniform brownish background, and absence of any projecting shadow from the head indicate that this portrait was made as a detailed preliminary study for inclusion in a larger painting.","346":"This painting and a Portrait of a Woman in Prayer (Kunsthaus, Z\u00fcrich) originally formed the wings of a devotional triptych. The young, well-dressed sitter appears seemingly transfixed by the now-lost central image\u2014perhaps of the Virgin and Child\u2014to which he offers a silent prayer as he pauses on a bead of the rosary held in his hand. The man\u2019s ring, bearing the coat of arms of the Dutch families of Six van Hillegom and Six van Oterleek, suggests that he came from the Low Countries. Cranach probably painted this portrait during his trip to the Netherlands in 1508.","347":"This portrait relates stylistically to documented works by Vanderlyn, who was of Dutch ancestry and practiced his profession in the region around Kingston, New York, in the Hudson River valley. While displaying a solemn expression, his sitter here wears fashionable clothing and jewelry. The pose is derived from a British mezzotint after a portrait by Sir Peter Lely (National Portrait Gallery, London). Although the drawing is awkward, the artist has shown a commendable interest in depicting human character. In her overlarge right hand, the subject holds a single rose in an explicit gesture that is also found in other portraits of young women by this artist, often signifying love and marriage.","348":"This panel was not painted in the areas where the mummy wrappings have would covered the edges. Once in the wrappings, the background was gilded, and a gilded line was drawn to frame the lower end of the painting. Gold leaf was also used for the wreath and the lower necklace, a gold chain with a crescent (called a lunula). The woman's face and neck are thickly painted in cream, heightened with pink on the cheeks and nose and around the eyes. The shades are built up from a dark ground. The woman's oval face, large eyes, and slightly open lips give the portrait considerable presence. Venus rings on her neck call attention to her youthful plump beauty. The hairstyle is typical for the period of the Emperor Hadrian, except for the corkscrew locks around the forehead, which may be a regional style.Link to the Artist ProjectY.Z. Kami on Egyptian mummy portraits","349":"In this portrait, George Washington (1732\u20131799) is shown standing on a bluff above the Hudson River with his enslaved personal servant, Billy Lee, on horseback behind him. The view across the river encompasses West Point, New York, with a red-and-white banner, possibly the Navy ensign adopted in 1775, flying atop the fortress. Trumbull had served on Washington\u2019s staff as an aide-de-camp early in the Revolutionary War. He painted this portrait from memory about five years later, when he was studying in London. It was the first authoritative representation of Washington available in Europe and was soon copied throughout the Continent.","350":"","351":"","352":"Because this portrait is closely related to Corneille\u2019s only documented painting (Louvre, Paris), it is a touchstone for attributions to the artist. Corneille pays particular attention to details of personal adornment: the fur collar, the ring on his index finger, and the ruffled cuffs of his shirt. Here Corneille includes the sitter\u2019s hands, emphasized by the expensive gloves he holds. This work seems to reflect the artist\u2019s northern roots and early style, whereas the surrounding portraits exhibit a more refined, courtly style that the artist developed in France. ","353":"A notebook kept by Fantin\u2019s wife is said to record the circumstances surrounding this picture. The sitter called herself Mme Leroy, a name the artist suspected was false; and she insisted on paying for her portrait in advance. She was accompanied to some of her sittings by an American named Becker, who also commissioned a likeness of himself from Fantin, dated the following year (Smith College Museum of Art, Northampton, Mass.). The couple\u2019s full identities, and the nature of their relationship, remain unknown. ","354":"The sitter in this portrait wears a pendant with a symbol of a military order. In the nineteenth century the sitter was identified as Don Pedro N\u00fa\u00f1ez de Villavicencio (1640\u2013ca. 1695), whose passion for painting led him to study with both Murillo and Mattia Preti. Unfortunately, this identification is incorrect, though the portrait may show another member of the Villavicencio family.","355":"A Puritan sailor of fortune, the Second Earl of Warwick set up companies in Virginia and the Caribbean, helped colonize Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island, and seized Spanish ships on behalf of the Duke of Savoy and Charles I. The latter\u2019s policies made Warwick side with Parliament as commander of the navy (from 1642). Despite allusions to his maritime adventures in the armor and ships, Warwick wears the everyday dress of an aristocrat.","356":"The sitters wear costumes typical of the upper-class citizenry of Cologne, whose members were Bruyn's usual patrons. The woman's exposed hair, visible in braids at either side of her face, indicates that the couple are depicted as engaged, not married, as married women of Cologne wore their hair completely covered. It is likely that the portraits were commissioned to commemorate their engagement. In the context of this work, the carnation in the woman's hand is symbolic of love, betrothal, and marriage.","357":"Louis N. Kenton (1865\u20131947) was Eakins's brother-in-law, having married Elizabeth Macdowell (1858\u20131953), sister of Eakins's wife Susan, in 1889. Elizabeth studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts in Philadelphia, exhibited professionally, and traveled widely. Her marriage to Kenton was stormy and apparently brief, and very little is known of it, or of Kenton. The title associated with this portrait, \"The Thinker,\" was at one time based upon an inscription on the reverse that apparently was placed there by Susan Eakins. Beginning in 1900, the portrait was widely exhibited and much admired. An oil study for the portrait is in the Farnsworth Library and Art Museum in Rockland, Maine.","358":"One of the most sought-after Netherlandish portrait painters of his time, Memling\u2019s meticulous attention to detail is notable in the remarkable naturalism of the sitter\u2019s physiognomy and the texture of his velvet, fur-trimmed tunic. The young man was likely one of the many Florentine visitors to, or residents of, Bruges, several of whom commissioned portraits from the artist. It appears that shortly after it was painted, the panel was sent to Florence, where it provided inspiration to Italian artists, who deeply admired Netherlandish painting. A Madonna and Child (Louvre, Paris) painted about 1476-77 and variously attributed to Verrocchio and Ghirlandaio, includes the same landscape vista and classicizing columns. The Italianate columns, which indicate Memling\u2019s familiarity with Italian art and would have pleased his Florentine patron, illustrate that the relationship between Northern and Southern European artists was one of reciprocal influence.","359":"The chic satin evening gown that collector and philanthropist Catharine Lorillard Wolfe donned for portrait sittings in Paris belies her reputation as \"quiet and unassuming.\" Wolfe, the first female benefactor of The Met, was said to be the richest unmarried woman in the United States. Her cousin John Wolfe encouraged her patronage of Cabanel, a celebrated society portraitist and genre painter, and other preeminent European academic artists. She bequeathed this portrait, amid numerous artworks, to the museum in 1887 along with an acquisitions endowment\u2014a gift heralded by the press as greatly elevating the profile of public collections of modern art in New York.","360":"Guy, born and trained in England, settled in 1854 in New York. Typical of his command of lucid form is this charming \"conversation piece\" (a portrait with narrative elements) commissioned by Robert Gordon in 1866. Three of the Gordon children have finished breakfast and appear to vie for a small corsage before setting off for school. Gordon, a founding trustee of The Metropolitan Museum of Art, collected American paintings, some of which he displayed in the dining room of his home at 7 West 33rd Street, depicted here. The room was decorated in the up-to-date Renaissance Revival style seen in our Gallery 736.","361":"Gerard ter Borch was one of the most compelling Dutch artists of the seventeenth century, recognized then as now for his handsome portraits and refined genre subjects. These splendid pendant portraits of Jan van Duren and his wife, Margaretha van Haexbergen (1975.1.141 and 1975.1.142), rank among the most important works by the artist in any American collection. Jan van Duren, a member of the elite ruling class of Deventer, poses in the rich attire of a prosperous regent, while his stately wife is no less suitably clad. Ter Borch presents his patrons in a setting devoid of detail: a simple velvet covered table and fringed velvet chair accompany the sitters. The restrained setting contrasts with and enhances Ter Borch's precisely painted subjects, dignified and ennobled by his sensitive brush.","362":"In the work of Fragonard, finish is a relative term. Here, over a brown tone, Fragonard shapes the composition in darker shades of brown, drawing and modeling with the tip of the brush and with strokes of varying thickness. Color and white are confined to passages under strong light toward the center of the canvas: the young woman's powdered face, her dress and cap, writing surface and stool, flowers and dog. A famous canvas from the early 1770s, the work should be read not as a portrait but as a genre scene.","363":"Boxing, well known in antiquity, was revived in England in the eighteenth century and afforded entertainment for all classes of society. Humphreys's portrait must have been commissioned by Wilson Braddyll, his manager and promoter, in anticipation of a well-publicized match against Daniel Mendoza, which was to take place on January 9, 1788. The portrait was engraved by John Young in a large folio mezzotint published on January 3. The young boxer is depicted in his defensive stance, on the turf, and wearing breeches, silk stockings, and pumps.","364":"This portrait of Washington and the companion portrait of Martha Washington (2006.235.327) were probably reframed either in 1876, for the nation's centennial, or in 1889, for the centennial of Washington's inauguration.","365":"The portrait of Alexander Murray (1755-1821) in the uniform of a captain in the United States Navy marks his appointment to that rank in 1798. The scene on the verso both celebrates his affection for his wife and family and memorializes their children who died.","366":"These celebrated pendants exemplify a genre of painting known as tableaux de mode (paintings of fashionable society) established by de Troy. Rejecting religious or mythological subjects, artists represented the latest interior decoration, clothing, etiquette, and social mores. Mars and Venus, relegated here to wall decoration, cue the narrative to unfold, while the eager dog hints none too subtly at the passions concealed behind delicate gestures. In the 1720s, the meticulous rhyming of curves among picture frame, chair-rail, and sofa was extremely in vogue, but in de Troy\u2019s composition it also underscores the theme of physical union.","367":"Carlin made four consecutive entries in his account book during October 1846 for sittings with the Allen Brothers.  He called them \"Eldest,\" \"Second,\" \"Third,\" and \"Youngest.\"  In the margin next to the names, Carlin wrote, \"In half length group $50.00.\"  William Barton Franklin Vanderbilt, and Harry were the sons of commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt's second daughter, Ethelinda Vanderbilt, and Daniel B. Allen.  Vanderbilt Commissioned the group portrait of his grandsons.","368":"Written in gold on a red background is an inscription that identifies this miniature as a self-portrait of the famous Bruges illuminator, Simon Bening: \"Simon Bennik, the son of Alexander, painted this himself at the age of 75 in 1558.\"Simon Bening became one of the most famous illuminators of the sixteenth century. He spent his early years in Ghent or Antwerp, probably working under the tutelage of his father, the illuminator Alexander Bening. Simon moved to Bruges permanently in 1517, where over time he headed a large and flourishing workshop. Although Bening was much admired in his day and widely imitated, his artistic personality has yet to be thoroughly studied.This miniature painting has attracted considerable interest in art history as an early self-portrait of an artist. Bening portrays himself, spectacles in hand, seated before a wooden easel. The easel holds a drawing of the Virgin and Child; along its left edge, small ledges hold various painting materials. In representing this imagery Bening allies himself with Saint Luke, the patron saint of painting, who is traditionally shown painting an image of the Virgin - a subject that itself became a conceit for the self-portrait of the artist in the 15th and 16th centuries. Bening portrays himself not in the garb of an artisan, but as a member of the intelligentsia. By inscribing his work with a signature (as the son of Alexander) and a date, he acknowledges his talents and heritage in the distinguished lineage of Bening illuminators in Bruges. The illumination was probably made as an independent work, rather than as part of a book, at a time when autonomous miniatures increasingly came into production. A second version of this miniature is in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London.","369":"Luitpold of Bavaria was named Regent in June 1886, after his nephew, King Ludwig II, was declared mentally incompetent. During the twenty-six years of Luitpold's reign, Bavaria prospered, and Munich became a cultural capital of Europe. At the time Lenbach created this work, he was the most famous portrait painter in Germany. ","370":"William White (1748-1836) with presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church in the United States (1789; 1795-1836) and bishop of the diocese of Pennsylvania (1787-1836). Birch based his portrait on John Sartain's 1830 or 1831 engraving of Thomas Sully's portrait.","371":"In painting this fine portrait, which dates about 1497, Fra Bartolomeo took as his model the work of Hans Memling, whose portraits of Florentine merchants in Bruges were well known in Italy. Like Leonardo da Vinci, Fra Bartolomeo had a keen response to nature, drawing landscape views in an album (for example, MMA 57.165; visit metmuseum.org). The inscription with the putative name of the sitter was added later.","372":"Although Signora Gomez d\u2019Arza did not belong to Eakins\u2019s immediate circle, she inspired one of his most eloquent portraits. An actress of Italian ancestry, she was married to Enrico Gomez d\u2019Arza, the impresario of a small theater that Eakins and his wife visited in the Italian quarter of Philadelphia. Susan Eakins recalled in 1927: \u201cThey were very poor, depending on their acting and Signora\u2019s teaching young actors, for a living. They could not speak English. Mr. Eakins spoke Italian and learned from her that she had had tragic experiences in her early life. She was about thirty years old when the portrait was painted.","373":"Burne-Jones associated this painting with a refrain from a Breton folk ballad: \"Alas, I know a love song, \/ Sad or happy, each in turn.\" Drawing inspiration from the gothicizing Pre-Raphaelite movement, the artist conjured a twilight scene with a richly romantic, medieval air, enhanced by allusions to Italian Renaissance art, from the warm, dewy colors to the gracious figures and original frame, which recalls sixteenth-and-seventeenth-century Venetian designs. When the picture was first exhibited at the Grosvenor Gallery, London, in 1878, the novelist Henry James admiringly compared it to \"some mellow Giorgione or some richly-glowing Titian.\"Listen to the song that inspired the painting.","374":"As in the Portrait of a Scholar by Chae Yongsin (2012.329), the subject here\u2014a young woman wearing a traditional Korean dress (hanbok) comprising a short jacket over a floor-length skirt\u2014appears in front of a folding screen atop a patterned straw mat, though she sits on a chair in three-quarter view. Floral motifs abound, highlighting the decorative quality of the painting: flanked by potted plants and a vase with floral decoration, the sitter holds a spray of peonies; the blue tablecloth is dotted with small flowers; and the background screen, faintly painted in monochrome ink, shows flowering trees rather than a landscape, the more standard backdrop for portraits of this time. Curiously, greater care and visual emphasis have been placed on the setting and objects\u2014note, for example, the gold-painted planter\u2014than on the sitter.There are very few extant portraits of women in Korean painting prior to the twentieth century. The Confucian belief in strict separation of the sexes and in female modesty deemed inappropriate the practice of a woman sitting for a male artist. This representation of an unmarried woman (as indicated by her long, braided hairstyle) is unusual in that it is neither allegorical nor part of a husband-and-wife double portrait. Purchased in 1943, this painting was recently cleaned and is displayed here for the first time.","375":"Soon after his return from London, where he had studied under Benjamin West, Pratt painted the portraits of Reynold Keen (1738\u2013 1800), a successful Philadelphia merchant, and his wife, Christiana Stille (1744\u20131777; 2008.243), a Philadelphia heiress. Their affable faces and luxurious surroundings describe their well-being, early in their married life.","376":"This impressive portrait, painted about 1618 when the artist was eighteen or nineteen years old, is very close in style to contemporary and slightly earlier portraits by Rubens, for whom Van Dyck was working at the time. In its insistence on volume and textures, the close attention to costume detail, and the passive pose and expression, the painting also adheres to an older Netherlandish tradition, as seen in portraits by Anthonis Mor (ca. 1516\/19-ca. 1575\/76).","377":"In his novel \"Pierre, or The Ambiguities\" (1852), Herman Melville fictionalized this portrait of his father, describing the subject as the father of Pierre, the hero of the tale. The portrait so fascinated the younger Melville that an entire chapter, and much of the novel's theme, turns upon the mystery of the sitter's character, concealed by his youth, informality, and apparent candor. The portraitist Smith never exceeded his mastery here of exacting technique in the service of expression. The artist's m\u00e9tier in such cabinet-sized watercolor portraits stems from miniature painting and the related art of \"stained drawings\" developed in England in the late eighteenth century. Smith undoubtedly also derived his technique from his father, John Raphael Smith, who specialized in stipple engravings of portraits and genre scenes in his native London.","378":"This is probably the \"natural-seeming and very beautiful\" portrait of a canon from Pisa Cathedral that the biographer Vasari describes in his Life of Andrea del Sarto. The canon was a close friend of the artist and helped him to secure his last commissions. He is shown holding a small prayer book, or Book of Hours.","379":"Cranach often treated the theme of Venus and Cupid, but this excellently preserved panel is the only version in a round format. Playing coquettishly with her veil and glancing at the viewer, Venus ignores Cupid, who is agitated by the situation. His arrow is missing, suggesting that he has been disarmed and is powerless against his mother. The picture was likely intended for display in a personal studiolo. Cranach might have painted the roundel not on commission but on speculation, to be sold to discerning collectors already conditioned by the tradition of medals and plaquettes to appreciate such refined work.","380":"","381":"Made by Gabriel-Raoul Morel in about 1815, this snuffbox of matte and polished gold with scrolling acanthus design contains a removable medallion with a framed portrait miniature of Marie Louise (1791\u20131847) by Isabey. The portrait forms a cover to a secret compartment containing two other miniatures, one of Napoleon I (1769\u20131821), possibly by Mirbel, and the other of the King of Rome (Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph-Charles, duke of Reichstadt, 1811\u20131832) by Isabey.","382":"These posthumous portraits of the Saxon electors Friedrich III, the Wise, and Johann I, the Constant belong to a series of sixty such portrait pairs, ordered by Johann I\u2019s son and successor, Johann Friedrich I, the Magnanimous, when he became elector in 1532. He intended the portraits of his father and uncle to serve as instruments of propaganda. The accompanying laudatory poems emphasize the passage of Saxon electoral preeminence from Friedrich to Johann, thereby implying the legitimacy of Johann Friedrich\u2019s own electorate. Completed in 1533, the extensive series demonstrates the speed and efficiency of which the Cranach workshop was capable.","383":"The sitter (1816-1894) was a lawyer and, at the time this portrait was made, a major of a regiment of Virginia volunteers in the Mexican War.","384":"One of Tintoretto\u2019s finest formal portraits, this painting depicts an unknown sitter now believed to be a German or Flemish merchant living in Venice. His bowl-cut hairstyle and clean-shaven cheeks distinguish him from bearded Italian contemporaries. Seated in an X-frame Savonarola chair, he strikes a commanding presence gazing directly at the viewer. Recent conservation treatment has revealed the lively brushwork in the folds of the cloak, and analysis suggests he worked from life with assured, gestural brushwork and few changes from his initial sketch on the canvas. Tintoretto was praised by contemporaries for the prestezza, or speed, with which he captured the likeness of his sitters, lending his portraits an acute psychological presence.","385":"This vigorously painted portrait of Augustine Roulin and her infant daughter, Marcelle, is one of Van Gogh\u2019s many evocative renderings of the Roulin family, undertaken some six months after the artist relocated from Paris to Arles. Van Gogh painted the entire family of the local postman Joseph Roulin. Here, the chubbycheeked infant is the focus of the enterprise. Her heightened expression in thickly painted brushwork suggests that the baby may have posed for van Gogh, swaddled in her mother\u2019s embrace. Augustine Roulin, by contrast, is an abbreviated presence.","386":"The sitter, a Genoese diplomat, arrived in Vienna in 1749. A year later he married a socially prominent eighteen-year-old beauty, Ernestine Aloisia Ungnad von Weissenwolff. As director of the imperial theaters from 1754 until 1764, Durazzo promoted Gluck's reform of Italian opera. This portrait probably dates to the early 1760s, shortly before Durazzo's departure for Venice.Martin van Meytens was born in Stockholm, where his father had emigrated from Holland. In 1717 he moved to Paris and worked there as a portrait-miniaturist. He travelled widely in Germany, Italy, and Austria, before accepting in 1731 the position of official painter at the imperial court at Vienna.","387":"During the six years he spent in Italy (1621\u201327), Van Dyck was frequently in Genoa, where he painted some of his most magnificent portraits. This sitter is traditionally identified as a member of the patrician Durazzo family. Whereas many of his portraits recall those of his older colleague Rubens, who had also painted in Genoa, this one testifies to Van Dyck\u2019s admiration of the work of the great Venetian painter Titian (ca. 1485\/90?\u20131576). The portrait has suffered from abrasion and relining, flattening its painterly effects.","388":"This handsome work ranks as one of Corot's most accomplished efforts at approximating Raphael\u2019s High Renaissance style. Its pose closely follows the portrait of Bindo Altoviti (National Gallery of Art, Washington), believed, in Corot\u2019s day, to be Raphael\u2019s self-portrait, but Corot arrived at this composition incrementally. X-radiographs reveal an earlier state in which the model plays the cello: the left hand held the neck of the instrument and the right hand, slightly raised, held the bow. Corot made several adjustments to these accessories before painting them out altogether, dropping the model\u2019s right hand to her lap and inserting a rose or pink in her left hand.","389":"This portrait of Martin Van Buren (1782-1862) is based on a photograph by Mathew B. Brady (1823-1896).","390":"Itinerant portrait painter Ralph Earl depicted the elegantly dressed dry-goods merchant Elijah Boardman (1760\u20131823) in his shop in New Milford, Connecticut. An unconventional setting for a full-length portrait, the work offered Boardman an opportunity to display his vast merchandise. An open door on the left reveals the shopkeeper\u2019s textile inventory, including silks, wools, printed cottons, and linens\u2014several of which he imported from India, China, and Europe through English ports. Although not pictured, Boardman also sold luxury goods from the Spanish West Indies, such as sugar, rum, molasses, and indigo, connecting the patrons of his Connecticut shop to the extensive networks of Atlantic trade.","391":"Salviati painted the Florentine medical doctor Carlo Rimbotti when both men belonged to the literary society, the Accademia Fiorentina. The vivid quality of psychological presence suggests that this was an informal portrait for a friend. The precise observation\u2014note the moles on Rimbotti\u2019s brow and forehead\u2014is in contrast with the formality and artifice of Bronzino\u2019s portrait that hangs nearby. There, the young man is psychologically distant and surrounded by objects that allude to his status and interests. Most contemporary portraits followed Bronzino\u2019s lead. Salviati\u2019s is a rare attempt to encourage the viewer to draw close to this remarkable sitter.","392":"In eighteenth-century Europe, Paris led the production of high-quality luxury goods. Parisian goldsmiths made a wide range of small, personal articles such as snuffboxes; \u00e9tuis to hold sealing wax, tweezers, or utensils for sewing; souvenirs, which contained thin ivory tablets for note taking; and shuttles for knotting lace. Gold snuffboxes and boxes decorated with portrait miniatures were prized and frequently given as royal gifts, often to ambassadors or members of the court in lieu of cash payments for their services. Coveted and admired, these boxes were produced from a variety of materials. The best were skillfully made of gold and embellished with diamonds, enameled decoration, lacquer, and other luxurious materials. By the middle of the century, the taking of snuff had become an entrenched social ritual, and the snuffbox, too, had become an important social prop. Snuffboxes were considered highly fashionable accessories, with some merchants advertising new boxes with each change of season. The popularity of snuffboxes extended to all levels of society, and for those who could not afford gold, boxes were produced in less expensive materials such as silver, tortoiseshell, porcelain, or domestically produced lacquer.","393":"Flinck studied as a pupil in Rembrandt\u2019s studio and, according to one early biographer, had so internalized his teacher\u2019s method within a year that Flinck\u2019s paintings were sold as the master\u2019s own. This tronie, or study of an interesting face, reveals Flinck\u2019s debt to Rembrandt in its use of exotic costume and attentiveness to the sitter\u2019s craggy physiognomy. However, by the time he made this work, Flinck had distinguished himself by developing a much smoother manner of painting, one that would serve him well as a society portraitist.","394":"The sitter (1808-?) was the son of Joseph Delaplaine, a Philadelphia publisher, and Jane Ann Livingston.  Birch's portrait is based on Thomas Sully's of 1807 (location unknown).","395":"Hans Holbein the Younger was one of the most celebrated portraitists of the sixteenth century. At an early age he won commissions to paint portraits of prominent merchants in Basel, and in later years he attracted powerful patrons in England, including Sir Thomas More. Holbein made several portraits of the great humanist and scholar Erasmus of Rotterdam (1466\/1469 - 1536). Shown in half-length three-quarter profile, his hands just visible between the fur cuffs of his coat, Erasmus is depicted as he appeared around 1530, when he was about sixty. Tufts of the sitter's gray hair poke out from beneath his black cap, deep lines mark the area around his mouth, and the skin shows signs of loosening below his stubbly chin, but the sensitivity and intensity of Erasmus's scholarly mind are still richly apparent in his piercing dark eyes. Holbein's close association with the humanist and scholar is reflected not only in these and other admiring portraits but also in the letters of introduction written on Holbein's behalf by Erasmus to his friends in England when the artist traveled there in 1526. It was through Erasmus that Holbein was commissioned to paint portraits of Sir Thomas More and his family.  The white label painted at the upper left of this panel is a later addition, made some fifty years after Holbein's death when the painting was in the collection of John, Lord Lumley of Surrey and London.","396":"Bernhard Strigel belonged to a family of artists that flourished after the middle of the fifteenth century in the town of Memmingen, near the Swiss border. In the first two decades of the sixteenth century he produced a number of portraits of ladies in extravagant dress positioned before a decorative brocade hanging with an open window view out to a landscape. The young woman in this (probably independent) portrait has not been identified, but her elaborate costume, with its imported fabrics and embroideries and ostentatious jewelry, places her among the elite echelons of society.","397":"","398":"The children of the third Duke of Dorset were painted at Knole, the Sackville family seat. They are (left to right): Lady Mary Sackville (1792\u20131864); the Duke's only son, Lord Middlesex (1793\u20131815), later fourth Duke of Dorset; and Lady Elizabeth Sackville (1795\u20131870). The picture was exhibited in 1797 under the title \"Portraits of a nobleman's children.\" The pose of the boy derives from a famous portrait of Henry VIII by Hans Holbein.","399":"James helped his elder brother Charles Willson Peale make replicas of his popular full-length portrait of Washington, commissioned in 1779 by the state of Pennsylvania. (A version of Charles' Washington portrait, 97.33, is also in the Met's collection.) The bright color and clean outlines of this small version are characteristic of James's style. After the Continental forces, assisted by the French, had triumphed over the British at Yorktown in 1781, James Peale sketched the battle site, including here a view of the harbor showing the protruding masts of sunken ships. The French and the American flags fly above the general's head and the banners of the conquered lie at his feet.","400":"Born in Ireland, Edward Guthrie Kennedy (1849\u20131932) immigrated to the United States at age eighteen. After a decade in the art business in Boston, he joined the New York art gallery Wunderlich and Company, which later became Kennedy Galleries. In 1916, he resigned from the gallery to devote himself to collecting cloisonn\u00c9 enamels and Japanese robes, which he later gave to the Metropolitan Museum. By 1895, when Chase exhibited this portrait at the National Academy of Design, the two men were friends and professional associates. Kennedy served as an intermediary between Chase and Whistler, who had a falling out in 1885 over the portrait that Chase painted of Whistler in London.","401":"Polk used his uncle Charles Willson Peale's so-called Convention portrait as the basis for this image; Peale painted the original portrait from life at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia in 1787. Polk portrayed Washington numerous times from various sources but never from life. In 1790 Polk wrote to Washington requesting a sitting and stating that he had executed fifty portraits of him during the previous year.","402":"Bessie Potter (1872\u20131955) was born in Saint Louis and studied in Chicago. She earned a reputation as a sculptor of statuettes in bronze that portray intimate feminine subjects. In 1899, she married the painter Robert Vonnoh and lived in New York, where she and her husband undoubtedly knew Chase. In this portrait, Chase captures Potter's sensitive but reserved personality. Her pose and the soft turban that she wears recall those in a self-portrait (1790; Uffizi, Florence) by the French painter \u00c9lisabeth Vig\u00e9e Le Brun (1755\u20131842), whom Potter apparently admired.","403":"Kilburn arrived in New York from London in 1754 and remained the unrivalled portraitist of choice in the city for nearly twenty years.  As seen here, he pleased his clients by offering them inventive attributes\u2014such as the compelling miniature portrait this young lady wears on her wrist\u2014and traditional English-style portraits.  He paid attention to detail, had skill in the rendering of fabric, and was able to capture a strong likeness, which was rare in colonial New York City.","404":"The fashionable painter James Tissot was Degas\u2019s friend and mentor in the 1860s and early 1870s. Posed in a studio, top hat and satin-lined cape by his side, Tissot is surrounded by canvases that reflect the wide-ranging tastes he shared with Degas: an exotic, Japanese-style picture; scenes of contemporary leisure; and behind the easel, a sixteenth-or-seventeenth-century Venetian subject. At center, a copy after a portrait of Frederick the Wise in the Louvre, formerly attributed to Lucas Cranach the Elder, pays homage to Northern Renaissance art. ","405":"Charles Goldsborough (1765-1834) was a Maryland statesman. This portrait dates from the year of his marriage in Baltimore to Sarah Yerbury.","406":"The English-born Philadelphian Thomas Sully painted this self-portrait for his host in Baltimore, Maryland, the broker Henry Robinson. The artist is shown interrupted at his work, with the primary tool of his profession pointed at his sharply lit head. This paintbrush device is common in artists\u2019 self-portraits, and Sully is thought to have adapted it from a similar work by Benjamin West, with whom he had studied in London. Although Sully\u2019s brushwork is unusually restrained here, its painterly quickness blends with the engaging spontaneity of the pose to create a sense of immediacy.","407":"Over a fifty-year career that included early training with Samuel F. B. Morse, Field became one of the most successful itinerant painters in antebellum New England and New York State. He developed a repertoire of compositional formulas to depict the features and surroundings of his sitters, who belonged to the emerging rural middle class. Field\u2019s portrait of a female member of the Bangs-Phelps family of Springfield, Massachusetts, presents her wearing an oversized, nicely detailed costume and holding a book in her right hand. The background is a soft gray color, with Field\u2019s distinctive shaded halo of space encircling the skillfully modeled face and sharply parted hair.","408":"This intimate image of Christ\u2019s head, intended for private devotion, derives from a lost picture of the Holy Face by Jan van Eyck, now known only through copies. Following the Eyckian composition, Petrus Christus treated the head like a portrait by surrounding it with a fictive frame, thereby underscoring the physical immediacy of Christ. His depiction differs from the prototype, however, in presenting Christ with furrowed brow, the crown of thorns, and drops of blood running down his forehead and onto his chest. These details stimulated a more compassionate reflection on the crucified Christ\u2019s suffering by engaging the empathy of the viewer.","409":"The painting was engraved with the title French Comedians, playing a tragi-comedy. The principal male figure wears an old-fashioned formal costume: a hat with plumes, a wig, and a fringed, skirted silver garment lavishly embroidered with palmettes. In the eighteenth century this costume would have been appropriate for a subject from antiquity. The heroine dismisses him, referring to the crumpled letter on the floor. The scene is imaginary as Crispin, entering from the right, represents a different vernacular theatrical tradition and in reality would never have taken the stage at the same time.","410":"Like his father before him, Matthew Clarkson was prominent in the political and commercial affairs of New York. He embarked early on a military career, distinguishing himself at the age of nineteen in the Battle of Saratoga. After his retirement from active duty about 1788, he followed the family tradition in his energetic participation in political and civic projects. He was an early advocate of the abolition of slavery. Clarkson sat for Stuart just after the artist's return from Europe. The portrait includes touches of Stuart's breezy aristocratic treatment but is primarily a straightforward depiction of this handsome New Yorker.","411":"The sitter (1736-1775) was born in Dublin, served in the British army, and, after 1773, moved to New York City, where he married Janet Livingston, the daughter of Robert R. Livingston.  Peale apparently painted this posthumous profile of Montgomery from an earlier portrait.","412":"Peale painted this portrait of his first wife just after her death in 1790.","413":"Soft light illuminates the face of a young woman dressed in exotic clothing and costume jewelry. Like Vermeer\u2019s famous Girl with a Pearl Earring (ca. 1665; Mauritshuis, The Hague), this painting was most likely not a commissioned portrait, but rather a so-called tronie, a portrayal of an intriguing individual, often in fanciful costume.","414":"","415":"This self-portrait, which La Farge painted in October 1859 at his family's estate in Glen Cove, Long Island, reflects his use of a photograph as a pictorial source; his appreciation of the unmodulated shapes and flattened space of Japanese prints; his reliance on broad tonal masses in the manner of his teachers, Thomas Couture and William Morris Hunt; and his experiments in plein-air landscape painting. The artist portrays himself as a landscapist ready to embark on a painting expedition.","416":"This painting of a horsewoman (in French, amazone) was long thought to represent the poet and novelist Louise Colet, muse of writer Gustave Flaubert. However, the sitter has since been identified as Madame Cl\u00e9ment Laurier. This work, made on the occasion of her marriage in 1856, forms a pair with Courbet\u2019s portrait of her husband (1855, Milwaukee Art Museum). The artist Mary Cassatt admired this picture as \"the finest woman\u2019s portrait Courbet ever did.\" ","417":"The fashionable portraitist Jacques-Emile Blanche witnessed this painting being made at the Villa Fodor, the family home of Marguerite Carr\u00e9, the sitter: \"One day, she [Morisot] painted before my eyes a charming portrait of Mlle Marguerite in a light pink dress; indeed, the entire canvas was light. Here Berthe Morisot was fully herself, already eliminating from nature both shadows and half-tones.\" But the painting required several sessions, since Morisot \"constantly changed her mind and painted over what she had done once the session was at an end . . . .\" The Pink Dress is one of the artist's few surviving early works.","418":"Georgiana Augusta Frederica was the daughter of Grace Dalrymple Elliott (whose portrait by Gainsborough at the Museum (20.155.1) is exhibited in Gallery 2). The record of her christening names George Augustus Frederick, Prince of Wales (later George IV) as her father, although her father may actually have been the 1st Marquess of Cholmondeley. She was reared in the Cholmondeley family and married William Charles Bentinck (1780\u20131826), third son of the 3rd Duke of Portland, in 1808, five years before her death at the age of thirty-one. Painted during the sitter's third year in 1784, the portrait is particularly well perserved.","419":"Seated at the center with his greyhound is the Honorable Henry Fane, second son of the eighth earl of Westmorland. To the left is Inigo Jones, a relative of the celebrated architect, and to the right Charles Blair, Fane's brother-in-law. Although shown in a landscape, each of the three men would have sat for Reynolds separately, in his studio. Reynolds's largest and most impressive conversation piece, this canvas was begun in 1761 and completed in 1766.","420":"The distinctive receding hairline and full lips suggest that the sitter for this informal portrait may be the dealer Jules Luquet, a supporter and friend of Courbet\u2019s beginning in the 1860s. In size, composition, and handling, the picture is similar to the artist\u2019s 1862 portrait of the painter Auguste Fajon (Mus\u00e9e Fabre, Montpellier), and it probably dates to about the same time. Courbet seems to have favored the format for depictions of people he knew well. A more loosely painted canvas in a Swiss private collection has been identified as a study for the present work. ","421":"The sitter, an amateur portrait painter, was the wife of James Pulham, an attorney in Woodbridge, Suffolk. In a letter to Constable of April 30, 1818, Mr. Pulham referred to this painting as \"the Compliment which you have so handsomely bestowed on her.\" Portraiture was a minor but remunerative part of Constable\u2019s practice. This is one of his liveliest works, with varied brushwork and glinting highlights played off against the sitter\u2019s matronly calm. ","422":"Like his contemporary Paulus Verschuur in the adjacent portrait by Hals, this man sports a wide-brimmed black hat, lace collar and cuffs, and a crumpled leather glove. But even working with these shared elements of respectable Dutch attire, Verspronck took an individual approach, favoring a far smoother, more illusionistic application of paint than Hals, his main rival for portrait commissions in Haarlem. Over the course of the seventeenth century, tastes largely shifted away from rough and painterly styles and toward the smoother approach of artists like Verspronck.","423":"This portrait was probably painted just before Goya contracted the illness that caused his deafness and affected him intermittently for the rest of his life. During his convalescence, he spent several months in the sitter's home; their friendship is recorded on the sheet of paper in Mart\u00ednez's hand, which reads: \"Don Sebasti\u00e1n Mart\u00ednez by his friend Goya 1792.\" Mart\u00ednez was a famous collector of books, prints, and paintings. He held the position of chief treasurer of the Finance Committee of Cadiz, a flourishing harbor town linked by trade with England and France.","424":"The daughter of a New England merchant, Matilda Stoughton (1778\u2013after 1822) was sixteen years old when Stuart painted this portrait celebrating her marriage in New York to the Spanish official Josef de J\u00e1udenes (07.75). Seated before a loosely painted swath of drapery, she wears a fashionable silk dress and is adorned with pearls, diamonds, and a coronet-shaped headdress. An overt display of wealth, the work signals her newfound status as a Spanish aristocrat and departs from the restrained portrait style preferred by most American patrons of the era. The elaborate coat of arms and Spanish inscription\u2014including Stuart\u2019s signature\u2014were added later by another hand, likely after the couple returned to Spain in 1796.","425":"When Andrews, an itinerant portraitist, painted the children of Nathan Starr in Middletown, Connecticut, he went beyond the traditional \u201cconversation piece\u201d format to offer an intimate view of the family playing an early form of badminton called \u201cbattledore and shuttlecock\u201d in a Greek Revival parlor, whose open doors reveal a sweeping view of the Connecticut River. In what appears to be a private narrative, the youngest child in the picture, Edward, holds a hoop in his right hand and a gaming stick in his left, pointed heavenward; his death in 1835 may have been the occasion for the group portrait.","426":"","427":"In the fall of 1866 C\u00e9zanne painted nine portraits of his maternal uncle, Dominique Aubert. The forty-nine-year-old bailiff indulged his nephew with multiple sittings and agreed to pose in various costumes. Whereas he is shown here in the habit of a Dominican monk, in another likeness (53.140.1) he wears a tasseled cap and robe.In the mid-1860s the young C\u00e9zanne applied paint thickly with a palette knife in emulation of his hero Courbet.","428":"Christus places his sitter in the corner of a warmly illuminated room and enhances the quality of his \"real\" presence by the fly resting momentarily on the fictive frame. The leading painter of Bruges following Jan van Eyck's death in 1441, Christus moves beyond the flat neutral backgrounds of his predecessor's portraits. The illusionistic inscription underscores the verisimilitude of the portrait, declaring: \"Petrus Christus made me in the year 1446.\"","429":"","430":"In 1774 Gainsborough moved to London, and by 1777 he was exhibiting portraits of members of the royal family at the Royal Academy. This full-length of the statuesque Mrs. Elliott\u2014a Scottish lady of great beauty but easy virtue\u2014was apparently commissioned by her lover, the first marquis of Cholmondeley, and was shown in 1778. Its elegance, delicate golden coloring, and fluid handling reflect the influence of Van Dyck. ","431":"In this commissioned portrait, as Marcel Proust observed, Renoir gave expression to \"the poetry of an elegant home and the beautiful dresses of our time.\" In the Japanese-style sitting room of her Parisian townhouse\u2014the d\u00e9cor and chic gown testifying to her stylish taste\u2014Marguerite Charpentier sits beside her son, Paul. At age three, his locks are still uncut and, in keeping with current fashion, he is dressed identically to his sister Georgette, perched on the family dog. The well-connected publisher's wife, who hosted elite literary salons attended by such writers as Flaubert, the Goncourts, and Zola, used her influence to ensure that the painting enjoyed a choice spot at the Salon of 1879.","432":"This compelling portrait of a Maryland toddler is widely regarded as an icon of American folk painting. Included in numerous international exhibitions since its discovery in the late 1950s by New York\u2019s primary folk and modernist dealer, Edith Halpert, it is now accepted as an important work by Joshua Johnson, the earliest known professional African American painter. Son of a white man and an unidentified enslaved mother, Johnson apprenticed to a blacksmith before achieving his freedom in 1782, becoming part of Baltimore\u2019s large free black population. \"Emma Van Name\" is arguably his most ambitious and engaging portrait of an individual child. Distinguished by a bravura demonstration of the presumably self-taught artist\u2019s talent and imaginative flair in its nuanced palette, compositional complexity, deft handling of details, and surreally scaled goblet that incongruously comes to the subject\u2019s waist, the work suggests the particular appeal of historical folk painting to early twentieth-century modernists.","433":"In this canvas of the early 1650s, the figure's pose follows a pattern Hals employed twenty years earlier, but here the arrangement is more frontal and contained. The resulting impression of reserve or authority is relieved by the relaxed expression, and perhaps by the French fashions of flounced sleeves and colorful ribbons at the waist. Vivid brushwork and the nearness of the foreshortened hat add to the portrait's immediacy.","434":"A coach and sign painter and Congregationalist deacon, Peckham executed portraits with keen attention to detail. The interior settings are careful delineations of his subjects\u2019 homes. Here, Anne Elizabeth Raymond (b. 1832) and Joseph Estabrook Raymond (b. 1834) are seen exquisitely dressed and surrounded by toys and possessions in the parlor of their family\u2019s home in Royalston, Massachusetts.","435":"A Welsh heiress, Frances Puleston was married in 1786 to Bryan Cooke, of Owston (Yorkshire), Member of Parliament for Malton. Sittings for the present portrait are recorded in 1787 and 1789, and the picture was paid for in 1791. Mrs. Cooke was concerned with education, and was one of the promoters of the Society for the Education of the Poor in the neighborhood of Doncaster (Yorkshire). She died in 1818.","436":"Delacroix rarely portrayed anyone other than his closest family and friends. His affection for Madame Riesener, an aunt by marriage, is expressed through the frank tenderness of this portrait. She was once known for her beauty: some thirty years before the date of this portrait she served as a lady-in-waiting to empress Josephine, and having caught Napoleon\u2019s eye, engaged in a brief liaison with him. After she died, Delacroix wrote to George Sand, \"each of the beings necessary to our existence who disappears, takes away with him a whole world of feelings that no other relationship can revive.\"","437":"Carmencita, the dancer known as the \u201cPearl of Seville,\u201d was born in 1868 in Almer\u00eda, on the southeastern coast of Spain, and became famous in her home country and in France during the 1880s. After she made her New York debut in 1889 at Niblo\u2019s Garden, she was besieged with requests for private performances. John Singer Sargent arranged for her to perform in Chase\u2019s studio on the evening of April 1, 1890. Afterward, Chase painted this lively portrait of the dancer, in which he suggested the audience\u2019s enthusiasm by including the gold bracelet and flowers they had tossed at her feet. Sargent\u2019s own portrait of Carmencita (also 1890) is in the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay, Paris.","438":"This brilliantly painted portrait can be dated on the basis of the stylish costume. Duyst van Voorhout was a Haarlem brewer, one of the most lucrative professions of the period. He had forty-seven pictures at the time of his death, but none of the portraits\u2014as was common in estate inventories\u2014is assigned an artist's name.","439":"This small portrait appears to be a rapidly executed study of mood and figure type. Degas, who was closely attuned to the nuances of gesture and expression, focused on capturing the woman\u2019s contemplative gaze, treating her costume and the background in a more summary fashion. ","440":"The sitter was a provincial artist and avid horseman, who specialized in equestrian subjects and also painted portraits and landscapes.","441":"","442":"Johann Joachim Winckelmann was the most influential early archaeologist and a pioneer in the field of art history. His History of Ancient Art, published in 1764, became a classic text for travelers and cognoscenti of art. He was also a close friend and admirer of Mengs. Both were leading exponents of the nascent Neoclassical movement in Rome. In this idealized posthumous portrait Winckelmann is shown holding a Greek edition of Homer's Iliad, alluding to his erudition and ties to Classical poetry.","443":"A housewife holds an apple, which in this context more likely refers to the New Eve (the Virgin Mary) than the old one. The birdcage and hearth imply happy domesticity, while the grapevine alludes to the woman as \"a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house\" (Psalm 128). The original buyer of such a painting, if he had opinions about art as well as women, would probably have described it as a nisstuck, meaning \"niche-piece\" or \"window-niche,\" an illusionistic format popularized by Gerrit Dou.","444":"This is Biagio d'Antonio's most distinguished portrait, and was painted in around 1470. Its sculptural quality is indebted to the sculptor and painter Verrocchio, who had a deep influence on artists of Biagio's generation. In the background Biagio shows the valley of the Arno river with the city walls and cathedral of Florence.","445":"Having just entered the room, the angel Gabriel is about to tell the Virgin Mary that she will be the mother of Jesus. The golden rays pouring in through the left oculus carry a miniature figure with a cross. On the right wing, Joseph, who is betrothed to the Virgin, works in his carpenter\u2019s shop, drilling holes in a board. The mousetraps on the bench and in the shop window opening onto the street are thought to allude to references in the writings of Saint Augustine identifying the cross as the devil\u2019s mousetrap. On the left wing, the kneeling donor appears to witness the central scene through the open door. His wife kneels behind him, and a town messenger stands at the garden gate. The owners would have purchased the triptych to use in private prayer. An image of Christ\u2019s conception in an interior not unlike the one in which they lived also may have reinforced their hope for their own children. One of the most celebrated early Netherlandish paintings\u2014particularly for its detailed observation, rich imagery, and superb condition\u2014this triptych belongs to a group of paintings associated with the Tournai workshop of  Robert Campin (ca. 1375\u20131444), sometimes called the Master of Fl\u00e9malle. Documents indicate that he hired at least two assistants, the young Rogier van der Weyden (ca. 1400\u20131464) and Jacques Daret (ca. 1404\u20131468). Stylistic and technical evidence suggests that the altarpiece was executed in phases. The Annunciation, which follows a slightly earlier workshop composition, probably was not commissioned. Shortly thereafter, the male donor ordered the wings, which appear to have been painted by two artists. At a later point, in the 1430s, presumably following the donor\u2019s marriage, the portraits of his wife and of the messenger were added. The windows of the central panel, originally covered with gold leaf, were painted with a blue sky, and the armorial shields were added afterward.","446":"This exquisite and enigmatic portrait and its pendant (1975.1.86) are most likely the works by the Venetian painter and illuminator Jacometto, recorded by the connoisseur Marcantonio Michiel in the collection of a Venetian patrician in 1543. Michiel, who praised them as \"a most perfect work,\" identified the man as Alvise Contarini and the woman as a \"nun of San Secondo\" (a Benedictine convent in Venice). The paired portraits and the allusion to fidelity on the verso of the male effigy (a roebuck chained beneath the Greek word AIEI, meaning \u201cforever\u201d) would normally suggest a married couple; however, her possible status as a nun makes it difficult to determine their relationship. If the garment is a habit, which seems doubtful given her bare shoulders, she may have led a secular life as a nun or entered the convent as a widow. The portrait may have been commissioned platonically (such cases are known). Alternatively, the wimple-like headdress may represent an entirely secular and contemporary fashion trend. Perhaps the portraits, which probably fit together in a boxlike frame, were designed to hide their clandestine relationship.Illustrating the influence of Netherlandish painting on Venetian portraiture, the portraits are striking for their meticulous detail, highly refined technique, and luminous, atmospheric landscape backgrounds.","447":"G\u00e9rard, a student of David, was first painter to the empress Jos\u00e9phine while the sitter, born Catherine Verl\u00e9e, was one of the celebrated beauties of her time. She seduced her first husband, George Francis Grand, in one of a series of liaisons that culminated in her becoming the wife of the statesman Talleyrand. However by the time this portrait was painted, about 1805, he had tired of her frivolity, and the couple had separated. Thus the picture is not a pendant to either of the portraits of Talleyrand (by G\u00e9rard and by Prud\u2019hon) that hang nearby.","448":"In this pendant to the portrait of her husband, Ignacio Garcini y Queralt, Do\u00f1a Garcini is evidently pregnant, which may account for the informality of her hair and dress. Josefa's mother, whose name was Van Asbrock, was of Flemish descent. This may explain Goya\u2019s palette and his handling of paint in a manner reminiscent of portraits by Rubens.","449":"A brilliant miniature painter, Jacometto was also outstanding at portraits. He was much influenced by the Sicilian painter Antonello da Messina, who worked in Venice in 1475\u201376, but Jacometto\u2019s portraits have a crystalline clarity, enhanced by the black background. The distinctive hairstyle\u2014a zazzera\u2014was fashionable in Venice in the 1480s and 90s. ","450":"This portrait is based on a prototype by Rigaud showing the comte d'\u00c9vreux as a young man that was painted in about 1703.","451":"The sitter, who wears the black-and-yellow striped dress of high-ranking members of the electoral court of Saxony, may be identified by the initials LS on the signet ring as Lukas Spielhausen, who was by 1531 a lawyer in the state judicial curia under Johann I, the Constant. His age of approximately thirty-nine in 1532, the date of the painting, is compatible with the sitter\u2019s appearance. The lively pattern of colors and interplay of curves in the costume and the contrast between the man\u2019s tightly bundled hair and his expansively projecting mustache and beard give this portrait a striking visual impact.","452":"The sitter of this handsome portrait has his right hand placed below his heart, suggesting the content of the letter he has evidently just finished reading. Although the artist remains anonymous, he must have been familiar with the work of the Venetian painter Lorenzo Lotto (ca. 1480-1556), who spent time in the north Italian city of Bergamo.","453":"Painted when the artist was probably in his early twenties, the picture is notable for its exquisite detail. It may have been commissioned by Borso d'Este, the duke of Ferrara, and its style seems to be a response to the vogue there for Netherlandish painting. Although transferred from wood to canvas, the painting is in excellent condition.","454":"This young man wears a red turban, known as a chaperon; his attire suggests the work was painted in the 1440s. The sitter\u2019s hands originally occupied a smaller area, but the artist adjusted their position so that they could hold a flower. The inclusion of the carnation (also known as a pink), is a sign of marital love and fidelity, suggesting that the panel originally was paired with a portrait of a woman. It is possible that it began as a standard portrait, but was changed to a betrothal portrait at the patron\u2019s request.","455":"In 1763, d\u2019Angiviller was in charge of the household of the dauphin\u2019s sons; he developed a close relationship with the future Louis XVI, who would later name him director general of the Bat\u00eements du Roi. He was deeply committed to his post, which was the equivalent of minister of culture. This carefully elaborated, brightly colored picture displays the intimacy and liveliness of the best Rococo painting. It is not a state portrait but a rather personal one, on a relatively small, domestic scale.","456":"This likeness of the wife of the French ambassador to the Vatican expresses Chass\u00e9riau\u2019s subtle defiance of J. A. D. Ingres, his teacher. He subverted Ingres\u2019s approach by casting a melancholic mood over the picture, by banishing bright colors, and by abandoning the master\u2019s meticulous naturalism and smooth polish for a stylized and painterly depiction of sitter and setting. (The countess posed in the garden of the French embassy in Rome.) When the portrait was shown at the 1841 Salon, critics objected to its Romantic qualities\u2014the expressive elongation of the head, the gazelle-like eyes, the pallor of the skin, and the delicacy of the hands.","457":"Francesco di Giorgio was a Sienese sculptor, painter, illuminator, architect, and military engineer. The precise function of this drawing is uncertain; it may record an idea for a tomb sculpture or perhaps a painting. The foreshortened architectural perspective and the downward gaze of the figures suggest the work was intended to be placed high on the wall of a chapel or nave. The male figure in the center, flanked by muses or figures representing the liberal arts, may portray the patron, suggesting a memorializing function. Alternatively, this vellum sheet may have served as the frontispiece for Francesco di Giorgio\u2019s treatise on machines, in which case, the male figure may be a self-portrait of the artist.","458":"An official in the War Department, Ignacio Garcini wears the uniform of the Corps of Engineers. The embroidered red cross on his coat and the badge of the Order of Santiago are decorations he received in 1806 and must have been added after the painting was signed. After the French invasion of Spain in 1808, Garcini became a collaborator, and in 1811 he wrote the book Chronicle of Spain Since the Reign of Charles IV: Account of the Persecution Suffered by Colonel D. Ignacio Garcini.","459":"","460":"Mrs. Joseph Anthony Jr., born Henrietta Hillegas in 1766, was one of ten children of Michael and Henrietta Hillegas of Philadelphia. Her father made his fortune in sugar refining and iron manufacturing, and served as the first treasurer of the United States. Henrietta married Joseph Anthony in 1785. As with many of Stuart\u2019s portraits of Philadelphia society women, Mrs. Anthony\u2019s likeness is endowed with an individuality and a sensuousness rare in American portraiture.","461":"The unusual round shape of this portrait suggests that Agate painted it specifically for its distinctive watchcase-style case. The case bears the mark of Wilmarth, Moffat and Curtis, jewelers and watchmakers who operated in New York City from 1830 to 1834.","462":"A critic once compared Carri\u00e8re\u2019s style to that of his colleague Auguste Rodin, writing, \"Rodin paints in marble and Carri\u00e8re sculpts with shadow.\" This self-portrait, part of a series begun in 1887, exemplifies Carri\u00e8re\u2019s signature approach. Nuanced umber tones and hazy brushwork create the impression of the figure materializing out of, or merging into, the surface of the canvas. The vague, misty appearance of Carri\u00e8re\u2019s work was prized by contemporaries tired of precisely detailed and realistic paintings. A collector from Connecticut purchased this likeness in 1893, probably at the advice of Robert Simpson Cassatt, the father of American painter Mary Cassatt (1844\u20131926). ","463":"","464":"Guidobaldo II della Rovere (1514\u20131574) was a professional soldier, ruler of the duchy of Urbino, and an important patron of armor. This portrait includes his batons of command and portions of the embossed armor made by Filippo Negroli of Milan. The right shoulder defense belonging to the same armor, one of the finest made and most imaginatively designed Renaissance parade armors in the all'antica (antique) style, is also in the Metropolitan Museum's collection (acc. no. 14.25.714i).","465":"The faint growth of hair on the jaws and upper lip identify the subject of this painting as a youth. Remarkably, his right eye seems to show signs of an abnormality that has been treated. The grayish fold of skin below the lower lid, the lack of lashes, and the slightly slack right cheek may be traces of the abnormality; the straight line on the lower lid suggests a surgical cut to relieve the condition. The palette of this panel is considerably lighter than that of the other panels in these galleries, but it does resemble that of certain paintings from Hawara in the Fayum.For more on the technique used to create this portrait, see 09.181.1.Link to the Artist ProjectY.Z. Kami on Egyptian mummy portraits","466":"Stephen Hooper was a merchant from Newburyport, Massachusetts.  Pelham wrote the following note in 1773: \"Agreeable to your directions, I have done your portrait in Miniature and have had it sett in Gold.\"","467":"This beguiling sitter is depicted as if in a transitory moment, seemingly about to rise from the sofa, a slight smile on her lips. Degas rarely painted a face that reflects such good humor and calm. The woman is unidentified, but may well have been someone the artist knew intimately. He executed few commissioned portraits, preferring instead to depict family and friends, and seldom sold the portraits that he did paint. This work was in Degas\u2019s studio at the time of his death and was included in his 1918 estate sale, as indicated by the stamped signature in the lower right corner. ","468":"This portrait of the Rotterdam merchant Paulus Verschuur, with one arm akimbo and a voluminous cloak wrapped around his midsection, displays all the swagger that made Hals a sought-after and influential portraitist. The artist\u2019s signature rough brushwork, visible for example in the lace and glove, fell out of fashion in his own lifetime, but eventually exerted a great influence on Impressionist artists of the nineteenth century.","469":"The abbot of this lineage portrait belongs to the Kagyupa order of Tibetan Buddhism, centered in the U (dBus) and Tsang (gTsang) regions of Central Tibet. Here we witness a bringing together of these two stylistic streams during the fourteenth century. The lama\u2019s face has a portrait-like quality\u2014his concentrated expression projected both within and outward to the viewer. He is seated on a lotus throne with his right hand in bhumisparsa mudra, like the Buddha Sakyamuni. This gesture is unusual, as the majority of portraits of Tibetan lamas from this period are shown with their hands in the dharmachakra mudra (preaching gesture). His lineage is seen in the upper border, and the Indian pandits in the acanthus border roundels further define its authority. At lower right is the officiating monk, likely the donor, holding a golden incense burner.","470":"","471":"Marietta Benedict Cotton (1868\u20131947) studied with Chase and became a successful society portraitist in New York and London. Chase later recalled: \u201cOne morning, a young lady came into my Tenth Street studio. . . . She came as a pupil but the moment she appeared before me I saw her only as a splendid model. . . . Such a model is a treasurefind. It is the personality that inspires, and which you depict on canvas.\u201d An unabashed eclectic, Chase shared James McNeill Whistler\u2019s predilection for monochromatic portraits and quoted the table at the left from John Singer Sargent\u2019s \"Madame X\" (Madame Pierre Gautreau) of 1883\u201384 (16.53), also in the Museum's collection.","472":"The picture dates from about 1650 and originally had a neutral background, as in the Marquand Portrait of a Man (91.26.9). In the 1660s or later the work was modernized by repainting the background; the monumental architecture in particular is unsympathetic to the figure's friendly gaze and natural pose. The paint surface is worn and has been flattened by lining.","473":"Marie Joseph Paul Yves Roche Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette (1757\u20131834), is most vividly remembered for the role he played in the American Revolution. For his service, he was awarded membership in the Society of the Cincinnati. He returned to the United States in 1784, when he was honored by his former war associates and was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws by Harvard University. An invitation from Congress and President James Monroe brought him to the United States again in 1824, and for more than a year his triumphal tour provoked public demonstrations such as no American hero had ever experienced. Peale's portrait was apparently painted from life in 1825 at the height of Lafayette's fame. The porthole format and piercing heroic gaze are hallmarks of Peale's style and appear as well in his many depictions of George Washington.","474":"Hanneman was a highly successful portraitist in The Hague, where his Dutch version of Van Dyck's style ideally suited the court city's cosmopolitan patrons. This portrait of an elegant young woman dates from about 1653. The detailed passages of lace were probably painted by an assistant.","475":"Chase and his wife, Alice, had eight children, all of whom appeared in the artist's portraits and figure studies. This portrait is of Roland Dana Chase (1901\u20131980), the Chases' youngest son. Writing in \"Harper's Weekly\" in 1901, a critic applauded: \"Witness the portrait of 'Roland,' who is depicted with splendid brush-work as a rollicking brown rogue, holding in his admirable baby hand the only note of color\u2014a red ball.\"","476":"Scriverius was a distinguished historian, poet, and scholar of classical literature. His wife, Anna van der Aar, was the daughter of a Leiden city councilman. In this pair of portraits Hals employs the scale, oval format, and illusionistic framing device that for several decades had been common in Dutch portrait prints. The male portrait alone was engraved in 1626, by Jan van de Velde II; impressions would have been sent to scholarly colleagues throughout Europe. The panels were retained as family keepsakes, in which Hals achieved  the same vivid effects that he usually described on a much larger scale.","477":"The Swedish portraitist Wertmuller worked in Paris until the upheavals of the French Revolution drove him to Madrid and then Philadelphia. In early November 1794 he completed his first portrait of Washington, which he replicated many times. With its fussy lace ruff and powder-speckled coat, Wertmuller's portrayal of Washington was both admired and condemned. Some proclaimed it the finest likeness of the president, while others, who preferred the work of Peale, Stuart, and Trumbull, deemed it overly precious and not at all like him.","478":"This arresting portrait depicts Yinyuan Longqi, the Chinese founder of the \u014cbaku school of Zen Buddhism in Japan. Yinyuan (known as Ingen in Japan) was born and raised in China, but after the fall of the Ming, he left the chaos of dynastic transition for the relative safety of Japan. The veneration of colorful, iconic images of teachers runs counter to the conventional understanding of Zen life as austere and iconoclastic. Portraits such as this would have been displayed and venerated during important rites and ceremonies of the Buddhist calendar. The inscription is by Yinyuan\u2019s direct disciple Muan Xingtao.","479":"This is a replica by Gainsborough of a portrait of the queen (Royal Collection) which he painted at Windsor Castle in September 1782.","480":"The identification of the sitter as Yun Dongseom, a celebrated scholar, calligrapher, and civil-official, can be confirmed by two other extant portraits in Korean collections. Here, the elderly statesman, dressed in formal attire, is shown in three-quarter view seated in a high-back chair draped with a leopard skin, and against a blank background. A heightened sense of realism guides the rendering of the figure, as was the trend in portraits of the time. The detailed treatment of Yun\u2019s face, through crisp, fluid lines and subtle shading, captures both his physical characteristics and strong personality. A quintessential example of traditional Korean ancestral portraiture, this painting would have functioned as the centerpiece of a family shrine dedicated to honoring the family\u2019s male lineages, in accordance with the strictures of neo-Confucian philosophy.Although there is no inscribed date, this piece is similar to dated works from the late eighteenth century. One detail that may narrow the dating is the belt: those made of rhinoceros horn and gold were reserved for officials of second rank or higher, a status Yun achieved in 1790. If painted during his lifetime, this portrait would date to 1790\u201395. Alternatively, the scroll may have been painted posthumously (likely within a decade of his death), a common practice for ancestral portraits.","481":"","482":"Lazarus M. Goldsmith (1800-1840) was the owner of a dry-goods store in Boston. The portrait was a gift to Louisa W. Dixon.","483":"","484":"Henry Scudder Platt (1798-1863) married Maria Frisbie (1800-1877; 49.18.2) about 1830. Family tradition has it that these portraits were painted on their wedding trip.","485":"Pepito's father, Rafael Costa de Quintana, was doctor to King Ferdinand VII; his mother was the daughter of Jaime Bonells, doctor to the Alba family. The portrait is most closely related to works that Goya painted shortly after 1810 and seems to allude to the Spanish War of Independence (1808\u201314): Pepito's jacket is tailored in imitation of a soldier's uniform, and his hair is cut in the Napoleonic fashion. The military analogy is further enhanced by the drum and the toy rifle with a fixed bayonet.","486":"This portrait seems to have been begun as a rectangle and then changed to an oval format. It is one of Stuart\u2019s most virtuosic paintings, clearly from his first years in London, but both its date and the identity of the sitter are unknown. The vague, brushy treatment of the background has raised the suggestion that the work is unfinished. Yet it seems rather to be inspired by Thomas Gainsborough, whose paintings the young American certainly saw and admired in England. Gainsborough also favored oval portraits and such light pastel colors as the pleasing green of the young sitter\u2019s coat.","487":"","488":"This portrait, representing Revolutionary War hero General Horatio Gates (1728\u20131806), was painted long after he led his troops to victory at the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. Although his military career was turbulent, the English-born Gates is represented in the uniform of a brigadier general, decorated with the medal that Congress ordered struck to commemorate his triumph at Saratoga. In his hand is a copy of the Saratoga Convention. The painting descended in the family of Gates' good friend, Colonel Ebenezer Stevens. The work is a blend of Stuart's more painterly English style and the Copleyesque forthrightness that defined American high style.","489":"","490":"According to the artist\u2019s personal registers, this portrait was painted between December 1, 1812 and January 31, 1813, and cost the sitter seventy dollars. It reveals the influence of Sully's English trip of 1809\u201310, during which time he studied with Benjamin West and found his stylistic model in the work of the English portraitist Sir Thomas Lawrence. In fact, this painting is a half-length adaptation of Lawrence's \"Elizabeth Farren, Countess of Derby\" (also in the Museum's collection). The sitter\u2019s dynamic gesture, turn of the head, and fashionable fur wrap\u2014as well as Sully\u2019s bravura brushwork\u2014are all borrowed from Lawrence. However, the American de-emphasizes the sensuality of the original work, stressing instead an air of charm and social standing suitable for a Philadelphia lady.","491":"","492":"In 1505 Lucas Cranach the Elder was appointed court painter to the Electors of Saxony at Wittenberg, serving successively Friedrich III, the Wise, Johann I, the Constant, and Johann Friedrich I, the Magnanimous. The sitter in this portrait, Johann, Duke of Saxony, Margrave of Meissen and Landgrave of Thuringia, was a member of the ducal or Albertine branch of the family as opposed to the electoral or Ernestine line. The bold design, dramatic color, and capricious but graceful outline of the costume are typical of the style Cranach developed as a portraitist to the court. ","493":"This portrait was created for Riwoche monastery in eastern Tibet, a branch of Taklung monastery. The central figure and the assembled abbots are not directly named on the painting. Nonetheless, two inscriptions allow a lineage identification: the epithet Jnanatapa (\u201cheat of wisdom\u201d) appears on the painting\u2019s veil, a name denoting a famous Indian mahasiddha, the spiritual fathers of Tantric Buddhism. The second is the identity of presiding deity above the central figure, named as Avagarbha. The importance of these two clues is revealed by their presence in the official history of Taklung monastery, which tells that the first abbot of Riwoche monastery was an incarnation of \u201cthe peerless mahasiddha Jnanatapa\u201d and that his Tantric teacher was Avagarbha, a Bengal siddha. Hence, this portrait is intended to invoke the spiritual lineage of Taklung and Riwoche monasteries through the person of mahasiddha Jnanatapa.","494":"This triptych, formerly attributed to Ludger tom Ring the Younger, was painted by an anonymous northern German painter. The donor family remains unidentified, but they surely hailed from Hamburg, the city whose church spires are shown on the orb in Christ\u2019s hand. The verses on salvation and afterlife inscribed on the tablets above the figures are in Low German, the vernacular of much of northern Germany. They were taken verbatim from a Low German edition of Martin Luther\u2019s Bible translation. Christ\u2019s presence in the midst of this domestic gathering bespeaks a deeply Lutheran understanding of Christ\u2019s direct accessibility to believers.","495":"","496":"This highly finished oil sketch served as the modello for a portrait now in the Mus\u00e9e Girodet at Montargis. When that lifesize canvas was sold at the posthumous auction of Girodet\u2019s studio, it was catalogued as Portrait of an Indian and dated 1807. The costume, however, is Ottoman, not Indian. Girodet was one of the most gifted painters to emerge from the studio of Jacques-Louis David. Returning to Paris in 1795 after his stay at the French Academy in Rome, Girodet developed a style marked by literary preciosity, imaginary pictorial effects, and exotic subjects and settings.","497":"Cranach became a celebrated court painter for the electors of Saxony in Wittenberg. Among the most popular mythological scenes produced by him and his workshop for his courtly patrons were those featuring Venus, in particular the Judgment of Paris. Painted about 1528, this picture depicts Paris, dressed in a contemporary suit of armor, as he deliberates over the fairest of three goddesses: Minerva, Venus, and Juno. While Mercury stands nearby holding the coveted prize\u2014a golden apple (here transformed into a glass orb)\u2014Cupid aims his arrow at Venus, signaling Paris\u2019s decision in favor of the goddess of love.","498":"Janet Halleck Drake was the daughter of the New York poet Joseph Rodman Drake and named for her father\u2019s friend, the poet Fritz Greene Halleck. She was about seven years old when she sat for Inman, who placed her in a fanciful woodland setting. Miss Drake\u2019s top hat is somewhat emblematic of the artist, who was known for wearing one about town. Inman exhibited the portrait in New York in 1825 and a reviewer found it \u201cbeautiful.\u201d","499":"These imaginary portraits of famous poets of the past, including two women, were most probably once part of album of thirty-six poetic immortals (sanj\u016brokkasen) that included accompanying sheets with poems.","500":"The portrait was admired for its truthfulness and the delicate treatment of the draperies. In his copy of the 1777 Salon catalogue, Gabriel de Saint-Aubin made a small sketch which has permitted the identification of the sitter.","501":"The sitter (1814-?) was the daughter of Thomas Dixon of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The portrait was a gift to Lazarus M. Goldsmith.","502":"The man is a shell collector, in an age when foreign trade opened up a wide world of natural curiosities. His wife holds a balance, symbolizing the virtue of temperance. De Keyser was one of the leading portraitists in Amsterdam during the 1620s and 1630s. He is best known for small full-length portraits, but he also painted large group portraits and small bust- and half-length portraits.","503":"Scriverius was a distinguished historian, poet, and scholar of classical literature. His wife, Anna van der Aar, was the daughter of a Leiden city councilman. In this pair of portraits Hals employs the scale, oval format, and illusionistic framing device that for several decades had been common in Dutch portrait prints.

The panels were retained as family keepsakes, in which Hals achieved  the same vivid effects that he usually described on a much larger scale.","504":"This painting depicts a woman who appears to have been crying or is ill, in the sort of unguarded moment that Degas explored in his art throughout his career. Painted quickly and with great economy, its emphasis on capturing a transient emotional state marks it as a study rather than a formal portrait.One early owner, the painter Egisto Fabbri (1866\u20131933), lent the canvas to the first exhibition of Impressionist art in Italy, held at the Lyceum Club in Florence in 1910.","505":"Elizabeth, sister of Prince Henry and of the future Charles I, was about ten years old when this portrait was painted.","506":"In 1934 the Anderson Galleries, New York City, sold this miniature alone, without a mate, as a portrait of John Hunt. Four years later this portrait and (68.222.33) were identified in the Erskine Hewitt Collection at  the Parke-Bernet Galleries, New York City, as Mr. and Mrs. Jason David Battles. Based upon a sale record at Parke-Bernet in 1944 the sitters were said to be Mr. and Mrs. James David Botter. In fact, the sitters have not been firmly identified, and the paintings do not appear to be a pair.","507":"In 1651 Colbert joined the household of Cardinal Mazarin, principal advisor to Queen Anne of Austria during the minority of Louis XIV (1638\u20131715), and one of the great collectors of the seventeenth century. Having recouped the cardinal\u2019s fortune, Colbert entered the king\u2019s service and, ten years after he sat for this portrait, was appointed minister of finance. He was instrumental in reforming the arts to serve the monarchy. In 1648, he and Charles Le Brun took charge of the Acad\u00e9mie Royale and in 1666 founded the French Academy in Rome.","508":"This is one of three portraits of women by Bol inscribed 1642, the earliest known date on paintings by him. The Dordrecht artist studied with Rembrandt about 1636\u201341, and then became one of Amsterdam\u2019s most successful portraitists. Despite the rich display of lace and jewelry in this picture its most appealing aspect is the sitter\u2019s sense of character, as in Rembrandt\u2019s portraits of about the same time.","509":"Portraits of children accompanied by animals have a long tradition in Spanish painting. Outfitted in a splendid red costume, the young boy, the son of the Count and Countess of Altamira, is shown with a pet magpie (which holds the painter's calling card in its beak), a cage full of finches, and three wide-eyed cats. Although they add an engaging element for the viewer, Goya may have intended them as a reminder of the frail boundaries that separate the child's world from the forces of evil, or as a commentary on the fleeting nature of innocence and youth. Manuel died at the tender age of eight.","510":"Stuart's most popular portraits of Washington are the so-called Athenaeum type, of which there are as many as sixty replicas dating from the turn of the nineteenth century until the artist's death. Often disparagingly referred to as his \"hundred-dollar bills\"--after the price of each painting--the striking portraits not only provided an income for Stuart but also made him a major player in the development of Washington as a cultural icon, as the works sold far and wide.","511":"In this portrait of his cousin Hartogh van Moerkerken with his wife, Sibylla, and their son, Ter Borch broke with convention by depicting the wife on the left\u2014traditionally the superior, and male\u2014side of the panel. The composition is asymmetrical, lopsided, and dynamic, and the young husband\u2019s gesture of showing a pocket watch to his wife gives the portrait an element of storytelling. This emotionally convincing depiction of a nuclear family signals a break with the dynastic imagery of previous generations, although an older tradition persists in the three coats of arms clustered in the upper left-hand corner.","512":"Born in Valencia, Spain, Josef de J\u00e1udenes (1764\u20131818) arrived in New York City in 1785, serving first as an assistant to the Spanish minister and later as the Spanish charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires. Following his marriage to New York-born Matilda Stoughton (07.76) in 1794, J\u00e1udenes commissioned Stuart to paint a pair of portraits commemorating their union. Stuart, who had returned from Ireland the previous year, drew on his knowledge of European Grand Manner portraiture in his elaborate depictions of the two sitters. J\u00e1udenes, formally posed and richly attired, exemplifies the power and prosperity of the Spanish Empire, then at the height of its territorial expanse in the Americas.","513":"The Count-Duke of Olivares was Philip IV\u2019s powerful prime minister between 1621 and 1643. This picture is either a preliminary model or a reduced variant of a large equestrian portrait of the count-duke (Prado, Madrid), painted perhaps in celebration of a victory over the French at the border town of Fuenterrab\u00eda in 1638. In full armor and holding a baton, he is shown as a victorious commander. His horse holds a dressage position known as a levade.The Count-Duke of Olivares was Philip IV\u2019s powerful prime minister between 1621 and 1643. Although of extremely fine quality and incorporating differences, this picture is probably a reduced variant of a life-size equestrian portrait of the count-duke in the Museo del Prado, Madrid. It may have been painted by his son-in-law, Juan Bautista del Mazo\u2014possibly with Velazquez\u2019s intervention. Olivares is shown in full armor and holding a baton, as a victorious commander. His horse holds a dressage position known as a levade. In the background smoke rises from the battlefield.","514":"Best known for his impressionist canvases, the French-trained Bunker also excelled as a figure painter and portraitist. This elegant painting of his wife, Eleanor Hardy Bunker, was produced soon after their marriage, just three months before the artist\u2019s premature death from heart failure. Its striking frame design by Bunker\u2019s friend, the architect Stanford White, reveals the collaborative nature of the Aesthetic age, in which painters and designers frequently joined forces in artistic production. Less than a month after Bunker\u2019s death, White, along with the sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens and Charles Adams Platt, worked with the Society of American Artists\u2014one of the leading progressive artists\u2019 organizations of the period\u2014 to purchase this portrait for the Metropolitan Museum. Three years later, Platt, a widower, married Eleanor Hardy Bunker.","515":"This group portrait of the children of New York businessman Jacob Thuthill Vanderhoof and their maternal great-grandfather Reverend Zachariah Greene depicts the interior of the Vanderhoof residence at 55 Seventh Street.  The family is surrounded by the trappings of a typical upper-middle-class parlor, including a tapestry velvet rug, elegant window draperies, a Rococo Revival armchair, and marble-topped center table.  This is the type of parlor that most middle-class Americans would have desired during the mid-nineteenth century.","516":"Louis XV succeeded to the throne of France in 1715 upon the death of his great-grandfather, Louis XIV, who had reigned for more than seventy years. The five-year-old boy was the only surviving son of Louis, duc de Bourgogne, and Marie Ad\u00e9la\u00efde de Savoie, both of whom had died of smallpox in 1712. The canvas is one of many versions of Rigaud\u2019s first official portrait of Louis XV, which was commissioned by the regent, the duc d\u2019Orl\u00e9ans, for the palace of Versailles.","517":"Vel\u00e1zquez most likely executed this portrait of his enslaved assistant in Rome during the early months of 1650. According to one of the artist's biographers, when this landmark of western portraiture was first put on display it \"received such universal acclaim that in the opinion of all the painters of different nations everything else seemed like painting but this alone like truth.\" Months after depicting his sitter in such a proud and confident way, Vel\u00e1zquez signed a contract of manumission that would liberate him from bondage in 1654. From that point forward, Juan de  Pareja worked as an independent painter in Madrid.","518":"This subtle portrait, with its smoothly blended surface and narrow color range, is believed to represent Jean Jacques Caffi\u00e9ri, Greuze\u2019s contemporary and a prominent sculptor. The sitter\u2019s mild expression belies a strong character. A very old label with the names of artist and sitter is glued to the stretcher bar that supports the canvas, so that when the work reappeared in 1912 it was tentatively identified with the portrait of Caffi\u00e9ri that Greuze showed at the 1765 Salon.","519":"Whistler's portrait of the great Victorian actor Henry Irving (1838\u20131895) recalls Diego Vel\u00e1zquez's court portraits in its format, pose, and restricted palette of black, white, silvery grays, and golden ochers. Whistler had been impressed by Irving's 1876 appearance in the role of the grandfather of Philip IV, Vel\u00e1zquez's patron, in Alfred Lord Tennyson's verse play Queen Mary Tudor. Discussing Whistler's canvas in 1907, the actress Ellen Terry suggested the associations with Vel\u00e1zquez that the actor and the artist might have had in mind in emulating the Spanish master's style. She observed that Irving, \"in his dress without much colour (from the common point of view), his long grey legs, and his Velasquez-like attitudes, looked like the kind of thing which Whistler loved to paint. Velasquez had painted a real Philip of the same race; Whistler would paint the actor who created the Philip of the stage.\"","520":"The unspecified red background and limited detail in this distinctive portrait place the emphasis on the first president's benign and noble face. It is a quality of Stuart's genius that in spite of the chore of having to paint so many replicas of his successful and popular portraits of Washington, he managed to bring to every one a significant difference in bearing and attitude.","521":"When Franklin arrived in France in December 1776 to negotiate for aid for the American revolutionary war, he was already a celebrity. His simple dress and refusal to wear a wig made an impression in intellectual circles and elsewhere. Franklin lived at Passy in a house provided by Jacques Donatien Le Ray de Chaumont who commissioned a terra-cotta medallion with his profile as well as our portrait, which was exhibited in 1779. The original frame includes the attributes of Liberty, Peace, and Victory, and is accompanied by the simple Latin inscription VIR (man).","522":"This work has been identified with a self-portrait that Mademoiselle Ducreux exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1791. The sitter's graceful pose and the sumptuous fabrics were admired by contemporary critics.","523":"This is one of Goya\u2019s most engaging male portraits. Tiburcio P\u00e9rez, a friend of the aging artist, was an architect, responsible for (among other projects) the design of the medical school on the Calle de Atocha in Madrid. Goya painted this portrait after recovering from a serious illness in 1819\u201320. P\u00e9rez's rolled-up sleeves and slight smile suggest an informality, directness, and warmth that are rare in Goya's oeuvre, and convey the affection the artist held for his sitter.","524":"","525":"","526":"Born in Utica, New York, Inman began studying art as a child. Although he was a prolific portrait painter, he is also credited as being the first American-born artist to have successfully attempted genre painting. \"The Young Fisherman\" is his earliest important genre painting, and was made to serve as the basis for an engraving. Relying to some extent on romanticized French images of peasants, Inman focuses on the innocence of childhood as the healthy boy plucks an insect for bait. The youth and promise of the boy are echoed by the lush virgin landscape in the background.","527":"Field copied Gilbert Stuart's 1803 portrait of the Scottish-born Baltimore merchant Robert Gilmor Sr. (1748-1822). Stuart's portrait is in the Baltimore Museum of Art.","528":"Van Rysselberghe\u2019s six-year-old niece, Denise Mar\u00e9chal, poses next to a marble mantelpiece and underneath a fashionable Japanese hanging scroll. At once innocent and self-possessed, the little girl holds her own in the geometric, structured setting. The portrait is one of the artist\u2019s first in the Pointillist technique, which he and other progressive Belgian painters adopted after seeing the work of Georges Seurat. Van Rysselberghe displayed his mastery of the method with deftly varied brushwork in the bold, patterned background and delicately rendered face. When he exhibited the painting in 1890, critics praised the naturalism and emotional expressiveness that he brought to the analytical rigor of Pointillism.","529":"This was one of forty-seven panels representing the lives of Christ and the Virgin that were made for Isabella of Castile. The picture\u2019s subject is the marriage feast at Cana, when Christ performed his first miracle turning water into wine. The convex mirror, seen behind the married couple, is a common motif in Netherlandish painting. The preparatory underdrawing reveals a number of anecdotal details that were never painted. Their elimination could be indicative of the painter\u2019s moving from a Flemish to a more Spanish mode, and may reflect the more austere style of presentation favored by Isabella and her religious advisors.","530":"The picture depicts a scene in the London studio of Benjamin West, who is generally agreed to be the figure standing at the left. Based on comparisons to self-portraits, Pratt is the man at the easel, an accomplished portrait painter.  The identities of the other artists represented in the picture remain uncertain, but they are younger and they draw rather than paint.  The composition explores the academic tradition as carried out among Americans in late-eighteenth century London.","531":"This royal hunting portrait was modeled after an earlier type established by Netherlandish and German artists. The young Prince Henry sheathes his sword while his companion, Sir John Harington, holds the deer's antlers. The light palette and rich decorative effect are hallmarks of Peake's style.","532":"Whether this portrait was painted in Rome, where Cosimo Rosselli was employed in the Sistine Chapel, or in Florence, cannot be said with certainty. The sitter wears a costly red doublet lined in ermine and places his hand on the edge of the frame, in a manner found in the Netherlandish portraits of Hans Memling. Netherlandish portraits were much appreciated for their descriptive truthfulness."}}
